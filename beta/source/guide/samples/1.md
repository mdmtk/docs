# MxFrameworkTestApp

This sample demonstrates:

* Setting the Clock
* Silently installing an application
* Silently installing a certificate

## Sample Location
This sample can be found in the `[MDM Install folder]\Samples\MxFrameworkSample` folder:

##Contents
The sample contains a few files:
 
* **Config.xml** : Sample XML to be sent to MX in the MXFrameworkTestApp
* **MxFrameworkTestApp.apk** : Test app that can push an XML to the framework 
* **Clock.apk** : A simple APK that is used in Config.xml to demonstrate application installation
* **Test.pfx** : A PFX file that is used in Config.xml to demonstrate silent certificate installation
* **MxFrameworkTestApp-Source** : Folder containing application source for MxFrameworkTestApp.apk


##Instructions
1. Copy/Push `Test.pfx` and `Clock.apk` to the `/enterprise/usr/persist` folder
2. Install `MxFrameworkTestApp.apk`
3. Copy/Push `Config.xml` to `/sdcard`
4. Launch `MxFrameworkTestApp` and tap either the `Bind Service` or `Send Intent` buttons.
 
If you navigate to the App Launcher, you’ll see Clock.apk installed, you’ll see the date, time and timezone set and you can create a WiFi profile with the MxTest certificate.
