# MX Management System Overview

## Overview

The MX Management System (MXMS) provides a common interface to Zebra Android device capabilities utilizing XML that conforms to the standard OMA-CP PROV (Microsoft MSPROV) schema. This allows developers and administrators to have an extensible, efficient, reliable and scalable means for configuring and administrating Zebra Android devices. MXMS exposes capabilities that underlying CSPs provide to give the user access to both privileged and unprivileged APIs. Each CSP exposes its capabilities using DSD files that are included with the MDM Toolkit. These DSD files are then imported into a DSDtoXML tool to generate XML that can be sent to the MXMS running on the device to change a device configuration or behavior.

## Definitions of Terms

### Board Support Package (BSP)

A BSP is the method that the device teams use to deliver the operating system for any of their devices. 

Every device ships with a specific BSP version pre-installed that is suitable for use on that device model, which is reported via the "Build number". The BSP version that ships in devices of a particular model may or may not be updated just because a new BSP becomes available for that device model. They can generally be updated by downloading a newer (or sometimes older) BSP from the Zebra support website and applying it to the device via the OS Update Process for that device.

### Android Open Source Project (AOSP)

AOSP is the method that Google uses to release and distribute the source code for the Android Operating System for royalty-free use by the open source community. OEMs are free to use, modify, and extend AOSP as needed, subject to certain standard licensing requirements. Each BSP for any of the Zebra Android devices includes an operating system that was derived, directly or indirectly, from AOSP. These BSPs generally also include modifications and/or enhancements beyond AOSP that provide additional value to our customers.

### Mobility Extensions (MX)

MX is the umbrella term used to refer collectively to the entire experience offered by the Zebra Android devices. This means that MX represents all the value that a BSP offers over and above that provided by AOSP, including:

* Changes and extensions to the Core Operating System (OSX)
* Value-Add Features (e.g. Multi-User, Whitelisting)
* The MX Management Framework (MXMF)
* Configuration Service Providers (CSPs)
* Changes and extensions to standard applications (e.g. Settings UI, Browser, Email Client, etc.)

>**Note:** All of the above components may or may not be present on a device. Specifically, MXMF and the CSPs may be absent. Therefore, these components would need to be installed on the device before they can be used.

### Operating System Extensions (OSX)

OSX is the term used to refer to changes and extensions to the standard AOSP as included in a BSP. OSX is versioned and the version of OSX in a device is the primary way to determine which changes and extensions are present in the operating system of that device. As a general rule, the version of OSX that is in a device can ONLY be changed by loading a different BSP (that contains a different version of OSX) into that device, via the OS update process.

### MX Management Framework (MXMF)

MXMF is a device subsystem that provides an interface to applications that wish to set or query the configuration of device subsystems. It does not directly implement set and query functions but provides a framework to support and host CSPs that do. MXMF can be built-into a BSP or can be added to a BSP after a device is shipped (via a patch applied via the OS update process). Applications and the MXMF communicate through an interchange of XMLs that conform to the **XML.DTD**, as described in the document **MX MF XML DTD**.

### Document Type Definition (DTD)

A DTD is a non-XML, standards-based document that defines the syntax of a class of related XML documents. It is used to specify the elements that are allowed to appear within all XML documents that are used for a specific purpose. 

The following DTDs are used by the MXMF:

* **XML.DTD** (described in the document **MX MF XML DTD**)
	* This DTD defines the syntax of XML Documents that can be consumed by CSPs that registered with the MXMF and that can be used to set and query the configuration of the device systems associated with those CSPs
* **DSD.DTD** (described in the document **MX MF DSD DTD**)
	* This DTD defines the syntax of DSD documents that are used to define the capabilities of CSPs

### Configuration Service Provider (CSP)

A CSP is a device code module that implements the ability to set and query the configuration of a subsystem on a device (e.g. Clock, Wi-Fi, etc.). The capabilities that are supported and exposed by a CSP are defined by a corresponding DSD. 

A CSP is a plug-in to the MXMF which can ship as part of the MXMF, can be included in a BSP along with the MXMF, or can be downloaded to a device as needed. Before it can be used on a device, a CSP must be registered with the MXMF on that device and all calls to a CSP must go through the MXMF. The MXMF and CSPs communicate through XMLs that conform to the **XML.DTD**, as described in the document **MX MF XML DTD**.

### Document Semantics Definition (DSD)

A DSD is an XML Document that conforms to the **DSD.DTD**, as described in the document **MX MF DSD DTD** and that corresponds to and describes the capabilities of a CSP. It is used by tools to enable programmatic generation of XML that can then be consumed by a CSP. Some examples of these tools are EMDK Profile Manager, Staging Tool, and MDM Console.

A DSD is created and maintained by the author of a CSP and each CSP must have a corresponding DSD that must be supplied when the CSP registers with the MXMF. A CSP and its corresponding DSD should generally be produced, maintained, and distributed together.

### MX Management System (MXMS)

MXMS is a term used to refer to the MXMF and all CSPs that are registered with the MXMF at a given point in time. It provides the ability to set and/or query the configuration of the device subsystems for which CSPs are registered with MXMF. There are three kinds of CSPs that are included in this:

* CSPs that are built-into the MXMF, such as the CertMgr CSP
* CSPs that are built-into a device and pre-registered with MXMF, such as the Wi-Fi CSP

MXMS can be thought of as "the MXMF and a collection of currently registered CSPs". Although applications submit XML to the MXMF, it is a bit more accurate to say that the MXMS (not just the MXMF) is the entity via which applications set and/or query configuration.

## MDM Interface to MXMS

Since Tier 2 and Tier 3 MDM Agents will not be signed, they must perform all privileged management functions by interfacing to MXMS. This interface is documented and enabled by the EMDK for MDMs and consists of:

* Constructing a suitable Request XML document
* Submitting the Request XML document to MXMS
* Receiving a Result XML document back from MXMS
* Parsing the Result XML document to determine what happened

### Recommended Implementation 

#### XML Created by MDM Agent

<!--
### MDM Agent Submits XML to MXMS

![img](images/quick-start/architecture-submitXml.png)

### MXMF routes XML to CSPs
-->

In this model, the MDM Agent would submit Request XML documents to MXMS, which would then process the XML and route it to the appropriate CSPs. The CSPs would attempt to perform the requested actions and would return their own Result XML documents. These documents would be combined by the MXMF Results Handler and one complete Result XML document would then be returned to the MDM Agent. 

![img](images/quick-start/architecture-routesXmls.png)

Here, the MDM Server has no inherent understanding of the Request and Result XML documents or DSDs used by MXMS, and the MDM Agent has inherent understanding of the Request and Result XML documents.

1. An MDM Administrator creates a proprietary command within the MDM Server using a Proprietary UI presented by the MDM Server based on a Proprietary feature-set shared between the MDM Server and MDM Agent. 
2. The MDM Server delivers the proprietary command to the MDM Agent via the Proprietary Server/Agent communications protocol. 
3. The MDM Agent interprets proprietary command and creates a Request XML document to perform the desired function using one or more CSPs based on a hard-coded knowledge of the capabilities of the available CSPs and the XML required to perform specific management operations using those CSPs. 
4. The MDM Agent submits the created Request XML Document to the MXMS and receives back a Result XML document. 
5. The MDM Agent interprets the Result XML document based on a hard-coded knowledge of the XML results that can be returned by the CSPs it uses to perform management operations. 
6. The MDM Agent forms a proprietary response that communicates the interpreted results and delivers it to the MDM Server Agent via the Proprietary Server/Agent communications protocol.
7. The MDM Server interprets the proprietary response and presents the results to the MDM Administrator using a Proprietary UI.

### Other Implementation Approaches

#### XML Created by MDM Administrator

In this model, the MDM Server and MDM Agent have no inherent understanding of the Request and Result XML documents used by MXMS. 

1. An MDM Administrator obtains or creates a Request XML document offline (using a text editor or a tool provided by Zebra) and provides the XML document to the MDM Server via the MDM Server Proprietary UI.
2. The MDM Server treats the Request XML document as an opaque payload and delivers it to the MDM Agent via the Proprietary Server/Agent communications protocol.
3. The MDM Agent treats the Request XML document as an opaque payload and submits it to the MXMS and receives back a Result XML document. 
4. The MDM Agent treats the Result XML document as an opaque payload delivers it to the MDM Server Agent via the Proprietary Server/Agent communications protocol. 
5. The MDM Server treats the Result XML document as an opaque payload and provides it to the MDM Administrator via the MDM Server Proprietary UI. 
6. The MDM Server interprets the Result XML document offline (using a text editor or a tool provided by Zebra) to determine the results of the request.

#### XML Created by MDM Server

In this model, the MDM Server has an inherent understanding of the Request and Result XML documents (but not the DSDs) used by MXMS, and the MDM Agent has no inherent understanding of any of them. 

1. An MDM Administrator creates a Request XML document within the MDM Server using a Proprietary UI presented by the MDM Server based on a hard-coded knowledge of the capabilities of selected CSPs and the XML required to perform specific management operations using those CSPs. 
2. The MDM Server delivers the Request XML document to the MDM Agent via the Proprietary Server/Agent communications protocol. 
3. The MDM Agent treats the Request XML document as an opaque payload and submits it to the MXMS and receives back a Result XML document. 
4. The MDM Agent treats the Result XML document as an opaque payload delivers it to the MDM Server Agent via the Proprietary Server/Agent communications protocol. 
5. The MDM Server interprets the Result XML document and presents those results to the MDM Administrator using a Proprietary UI presented by the MDM Server based on a hard-coded knowledge of the XML results that can be returned by CSPs the MDM Server uses to perform management operations.

#### XML Created by MDM Server Using DSD

In this model, the MDM Server has an inherent understanding of the Request and Result XML documents and DSDs used by MXMS, but the MDM Agent does not. 

1. An MDM Administrator creates a Request XML document within the MDM Server using a Data-Driven UI presented by the MDM Server based on a selected DSD. 
2. The MDM Server delivers the Request XML document to the MDM Agent via the Proprietary Server/Agent communications protocol. 
3. The MDM Agent treats the Request XML document as an opaque payload and submits it to the MXMS and receives back a Result XML document. 
4. The MDM Agent treats the Result XML document as an opaque payload delivers it to the MDM Server Agent via the Proprietary Server/Agent communications protocol. 
5. The MDM Server interprets the Result XML document and presents those results to the MDM Administrator using a Data-Driven UI presented by the MDM Server based on the corresponding DSD.

## MX on Devices

The MX version on a specific device can be effected by:

* OS Updates
* EMDK for Android Device Runtime Updates

With each version of MX, new CSPs can be introduced, and pre-existing CSPs can also have new behavior. It is generally not found that MX updates will remove or change pre-existing behavior unless specifically noted.
