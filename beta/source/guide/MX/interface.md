# MX Management System Interface

In order to communicate with the MXMS, you must setup a binding to the service. Once this reference is established you can then:

* Send XML to change device behavior or configuration
* Query for current device and framework settings
* Process results sent back from the MXMS

## Requirements 

* Zebra Android Device with MX
* Android ADT

## Setup Code ###
1. Create a new Android project with an empty activity in Eclipse.   

2. The following permissions needs to be added to your application's manifest file to allow it to access MXMS.

		:::xml
        <uses-permission android:name="com.symbol.mxmf.ACCESS_MX_MANAGEMENT_FRAMEWORK_SERVICE" />
		<uses-permission android:name="com.motorolasolutions.emdk.mxframework.ACCESS_MX_MANAGEMENT_FRAMEWORK_SERVICE"/>
		
3. Create two new packages in your application. One package should be named `com.symbol.mxmf` and the other package should be named `com.motorolasolutions.emdk.mxframework`. These packages will be used for holding the aidl (Android Interface Definition Language) files.

4. The SimpleMdmToolKitSample project, which is supplied in the MDM Toolkit, contains the IMxFrameworkService.aidl files that should be copied into your application. These AIDL files are located in the SimpleMdmToolKitSample's `com.symbol.mxmf` and `com.motorolasolutions.emdk.mxframework` packages. These AIDL files should be copied into the respective packages that were made in Step 2.

5. In the package that contains the empty activity that was created in Step 1, copy and paste the following classes from the SimpleMdmToolKitSample project's `com.symbol.simplemdmtoolkitsample` package:

	* MxNamespace.java
	* MxNamespaceMotorolaSolutions.java
	* MxNamespaceSymbol.java
	* SymbolBrand.java
	* XmlParser.java

	>**Note:** The package names in these classes will need to be edited to match the package name of your application.

6. In your application's activity, the onCreate method should call the init method that is in the SymbolBrand class. This will check that MXMS is installed on the device. If MXMS is detected, your application will be bound to MXMS, allowing interaction to occur between them.

		:::java
		// Variable to hold the main activity
		static private Activity m_activity;
	
		@Override
		protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)
		{
			super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
			setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
			
			// Save the main activity so it can be accessed from other threads
			m_activity = this;

			// Call init ONCE to start the process of binding to the MXMS
			// Note: You should call init early (e.g. as shown here in onCreate)
			//       XML cannot be submitted to the MXMS the binding is complete
			SymbolBrand.MXMS.init(this,mMxFrameworkServiceConnection);
		}

7. The ServiceConnection will also need to be added to your application's activity. This will contain the onServiceConnected callback that will notify your application that it was successfully bound to MXMS. It should also contain the onServiceDisconnected callback that will notify your application when it was successfully unbound with MXMS.

		:::java
		// This definition is mandatory to track binding to the MXMS
		private ServiceConnection mMxFrameworkServiceConnection = new ServiceConnection()
		{
			// Callback to notify when binding to the MXMS has completed
			public void onServiceConnected(ComponentName className,IBinder service)
			{
			
			}
			
			// Callback to notify when unbinding from the MXMS has occurred
			public void onServiceDisconnected(ComponentName className)
			{
			
			}
		}; 

8. In the onServiceConnected method, the onServiceConnected in the SymbolBrand helper class should also be called, which will notify this class that your application was bound to MXMS. At the end of the method, the term method in the SymbolBrand class should be called, which will unbind your application from MXMS. The application can also exit at this point. In the onServiceDisconnected method, the onServiceDisconnected method in the SymbolBrand helper class should also be called, which will notify this class that your application was unbound from MXMS.

		:::java
		// This definition is mandatory to track binding to the MXMS
		private ServiceConnection mMxFrameworkServiceConnection = new ServiceConnection()
		{
			// Callback to notify when binding to the MXMS has completed
			public void onServiceConnected(ComponentName className,IBinder service)
			{
				// Pass the binding notification on so the helper class can know the service was bound
				SymbolBrand.MXMS.onServiceConnected(className,service);

				// Call term 
				SymbolBrand.MXMS.term(m_activity,mMxFrameworkServiceConnection);

				// Exit the application
				m_activity.finish();	    		
			}
			
			// Callback to notify when unbinding from the MXMS has occurred
			public void onServiceDisconnected(ComponentName className)
			{
				// Pass the unbinding notification on so the helper class can know the service was unbound
				SymbolBrand.MXMS.onServiceDisconnected(className);
			}
		};    


<!--
>Note: The code and variables referenced here will be used in other documents that discuss submitting XML as well as sending queries.

1. Create a new Android project with an empty activity in Eclipse.  
2. Create a new package in your application with the following name `com.symbol.mxmf`. This will be used for holding the aidl (Android Interface Definition Language)file.  
3. Create a file called `IMxFrameworkService.aidl` inside the new package.
4. Copy the following code into your aidl file, which defines to MXMS Interface:

        :::java
	    package com.symbol.mxmf;
     
	    // IMxFrameworkService.aidl
	    // Declare any non-default types here with import statements
	
	    /**
	     *  MX Management Framework AIDL service interface
	     */
		interface IMxFrameworkService {
	      /**
		   * Provide Mx Framework Service(s) to process a clinet's request
		   * @param  sRequest - request String in XML format sent by a client
		   * @return a String from Mx Framework Service's response in XML format
		   */
	       String processXML(String sRequest);
    
	       /**
		   * Provide Mx Framework Service(s) to process a clinet's request
		   * @param  sRequest - request String in XML format sent by a client
		   * @param  mapExtra - a map that contains Extra information on how the request XML should be applied
		   * @return a String from Mx Framework Service's response in XML format
		   */
	       String processXmlRequest(String sRequest, in Map mapExtra);
	
	       /**
		    * Get value from CSP by providing a key
		    * @param  sKey - a key that CSP would understand, then return a value to MxFramework.
		    * @return a value
		    */
	        String getValue(String sKey);
		}

5. Add the Permission `<uses-permission android:name = "com.symbol.mxmf.ACCESS_MX_MANAGEMENT_FRAMEWORK_SERVICE" />` to your manifest file to allow MXMS accesses. 
6. Implement `ServiceConnection` from your MainActivity, and add unimplemented methods. You should now have methods for `onServiceConnected` and `onServiceDisconnected`. 
7. Copy the following variables to the top of your MainActivity for holding values needed for MXMS.  

        :::java
		//Application Context for MX 
		Context context = null;
		
	    //MX Framework package name
		private static final String MX_FRAMEWORK_PKG ="com.symbol.mxmf";
	
		//MX Framework service class name
		private static final String MX_FRAMEWORK_SERVICE_CLS ="com.symbol.mxmf.MxFrameworkService";
	
		//MX service holder
		public IMxFrameworkService MXservice = null;
8. Add the following method to `MainActivity` for binding to the MXMS service. 

        :::java
	    void bindService(){
		    //Bind to Remote Service
		    Intent bindServiceIntent = new Intent();
		    //Set Component
		    bindServiceIntent.setComponent(new ComponentName(MX_FRAMEWORK_PKG, MX_FRAMEWORK_SERVICE_CLS));
		
		    try{
			    this.context.bindService(bindServiceIntent, this, Context.BIND_AUTO_CREATE);
		    }
		    catch(Exception e)
		    {
			    Log.e("MX", e.toString());		
		    }
	    }
9. Add the following code to `onCreate` for getting the application context and calling the binding method. 

        :::java
	    //Get Application Context
	    this.context = this.getApplicationContext();
	
	    // Call bindService
		bindService();
10. Add the following code to `onServiceConnected` to set the service reference. 

        :::java
	    //Set service
		this.MXService = IMxFrameworkService.Stub.asInterface(service);
11. Add the following code to `onServiceDisconnected` to set the service reference to null. 

        :::java
	    //Set service to null
		this.MXService=null;

>Note:  
> you can use the following code to close the connection to MX. 
>
>     :::java
>     //Unbind service
>     this.context.unbindService(this);
>
>     //Set service to null
>     this.MXService = null;
