Management of the devices is performed through a provisioning XML files that are submitted via MX framework APIs that reside on Zebra devices. MDM Clients do not have to be signed by Zebra in order to utilize this functionality. This document describes the components of the toolkit and contains the information on how to use the tool to generate the correct XML as well as code examples for interfacing with the MX framework from within the MDM client application.\n\nTo **Jump Right In**, follow the [Quick Start Guide](#tutorials-quickstart) which walks through the process and tools you will be using.\n\n\n### Folder structure\n* **Documentation** : instructions for XML handling, CSP reference\n* **DSD To XML**: tool used for generating XML modules\n* **MX**: DSD files used by the DSDtoXML tool \n* **Samples**: Sample project code\n\n## Components\n\n### Documentation\nThis documentation contains information to get you started with interfacing with the MX framework from your MDM client. It also contains reference information for XML generation, submission as well as handling responses. The included CSP reference supplies important usage notes as well as device compatibility information. Be sure to check the [Using This Help](#abouthelp) guide for more information on how to use this help system\n\n\n### DSDtoXML Tool\nThe DSDtoXMl tool is found in the `DSD To XML` folder of this toolkit. It allows you to create XML modules to perform certain actions with the MX framework. This tool takes in a DSD file for a given CSP and then outputs an XML file that will be used by the MDM client. Be sure to read more about [generating xml](..-xml-generate). \n\n### Sample Projects\nA few sample projects are included as part of the toolkit to get you started. These projects can be imported directly into your Android IDE and run on a supported device. The samples can be found in the `Samples` folder of this toolkit.\n\n\n## Supported Devices\nThis version of the MDM toolkit supports the following devices and versions of MX:\n\n* Devices\n\t* TC55\n\n* Operating Systems\n\t* KitKat Zebra Rebranded\n\n* MX\n\t* 4.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"key":"guide-abouthelp","name":"About MDM Toolkit Help","md":"#About MDM Toolkit Help\n\n##Overview\n\nWelcome to the MDM Toolkit Documentation.
