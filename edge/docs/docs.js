Management of the devices is performed through a provisioning XML files that are submitted via MX framework APIs that reside on Zebra devices. MDM Clients do not have to be signed by Zebra in order to utilize this functionality. This document describes the components of the toolkit and contains the information on how to use the tool to generate the correct XML as well as code examples for interfacing with the MX framework from within the MDM client application.\n\nTo **Jump Right In**, follow the [Quick Start Guide](#tutorials-quickstart) which walks through the process and tools you will be using.\n\n\n### Folder structure\n* **Documentation** : instructions for XML handling, CSP reference\n* **DSD To XML**: tool used for generating XML modules\n* **MX**: DSD files used by the DSDtoXML tool \n* **Samples**: Sample project code\n\n## Components\n\n### Documentation\nThis documentation contains information to get you started with interfacing with the MX framework from your MDM client. It also contains reference information for XML generation, submission as well as handling responses. The included CSP reference supplies important usage notes as well as device compatibility information. Be sure to check the [Using This Help](#abouthelp) guide for more information on how to use this help system\n\n\n### DSDtoXML Tool\nThe DSDtoXMl tool is found in the `DSD To XML` folder of this toolkit. It allows you to create XML modules to perform certain actions with the MX framework. This tool takes in a DSD file for a given CSP and then outputs an XML file that will be used by the MDM client. Be sure to read more about [generating xml](..-xml-generate). \n\n### Sample Projects\nA few sample projects are included as part of the toolkit to get you started. These projects can be imported directly into your Android IDE and run on a supported device. The samples can be found in the `Samples` folder of this toolkit.\n\n\n## Supported Devices\nThis version of the MDM toolkit supports the following devices and versions of MX:\n\n* Devices\n\t* TC55\n\n* Operating Systems\n\t* KitKat Zebra Rebranded\n\n* MX\n\t* 4.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"key":"guide-abouthelp","name":"About MDM Toolkit Help","md":"#About MDM Toolkit Help\n\n##Overview\n\nWelcome to the MDM Toolkit Documentation.

By default, Whitelisting is turned off. When Whitelisting is turned off, no restrictions are imposed. When Whitelisting is turned on, using the AccessMgr Feature Type, various restrictions can be imposed.\n\nWhitelisting is a process which allows only applications to run which are explicitly specified in a list, which is called the \"white\" list. All other applications are prohibited from running. The AccessMgr Feature Type allows the \"white\" list of applications that are allowed to be installed and/or launched to be maintained. The AccessMgr Feature Type also allows control of which applications are allowed to submit XML for all of the Feature Types, including the AccessMgr Feature Type.\n\nWhitelisting only applies to user applications and will never have any effect on System applications. System applications are those applications that are built into the device and hence are always installed. Some control of System applications can be accomplished by using the AppMgr Feature Type.\n\nUser applications are those applications that are not built into the device and hence must be installed onto a device before they can be used. Whitelisting can be used to control whether a device user is allowed to install a user application, but cannot control whether an application can be installed programmatically by using the AppMgr Feature Type. Whitelisting can also be used to control whether a user application can be launched, via any means, once it is installed.\n\n>**Note:** It is important to understand that if a user application uses the AccessMgr Feature Type to turn on Whitelisting, then that application will become subject to Whitelisting. If the application does not add itself to the \"white\" list, then that application will no longer be allowed to run. Also, if such an application does not explicitly allow itself to submit XML, then it would not be able to alter the configuration once it was successfully applied.\n\nThe AccessMgr Feature Type also provides the option to control whether the device user can access a full or reduced version of in-device System Settings Menu.\n\n### Main Functionality\n\n* Turn Whitelisting on or off\n* Manage the \"white\" list of applications that a device user can install and that can be launched\n* Turn verification of application signatures on or off\n* Control which applications are allowed to submit XML\n* Select whether the device user can use Full or Reduced Settings\n* Set Application Verification Mode to Verify All App Signature\n\n##Parameter Notes\n### Operation Mode\nPivotal parm: Yes\n\nDescription: \n\n>Select the desired Operation Mode which will turn Whitelisting on or off. Whitelisting is turned off by default, and hence no restrictions are imposed on which applications device users can install or which applications can be launched.\n\n>Turning on Whitelisting allows a device to be made more secure by preventing a device user from installing applications that are not on the \"white\" list and by preventing all launching of applications that are not on the \"white\" list. Turning on Whitelisting also complicates the process of deploying applications since applications that are deployed and installed will have to also be added to the \"white\" list before they can be launched.\n\n<div class=\"parm-table\">\n <table class=\"table\">\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<th>Parm Option Name</th>\n\t\t<th>Parm Value</th>\n\t\t<th>Description</th>\n\t</tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Single User without Whitelist</td>\n    <td>\"1\"</td>\n\t<td>This value will cause Whitelisting to be turned off and hence disable all Whitelisting functionality.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Single User with Whitelist</td>\n    <td>\"2\"</td>\n\t<td>This value will cause Whitelisting to be turned on and hence enable Whitelisting functionality.

Signature verification is turned off by default.\n\n>When Whitelisting is turned on but Signature verification is turned off, the determination of whether an application is on the \"white\" list is made solely by comparing the Android Package Name. This is insecure since it cannot prevent a potentially rogue application from setting it's Package Name to be one that is known to be on the \"white\" list, and hence circumvent Whitelisting by impersonating a trusted application.\n\n>To increase security, Signature verification can be turned on. When Signature verification is turned on, the determination of whether an application is on the \"white\" list will be based on both its Package Name and its Signature. For that to work, the Signature must be provided for every application that is added to the \"white\" list so it can be compared against the actual Signature of that application.\n\n>Signature verification is more secure since only a specific \"authentic\" version, as identified by its Signature, of a given application, whose Package Name is on the \"white\" list, will be allowed to be installed and launched.  Turning on Signature verification also complicates the process of deploying applications since a unique Signature will need to be configured for each application as part of adding that application to the \"white\" list.\n\n<div class=\"parm-table\">\n <table class=\"table\">\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<th>Parm Option Name</th>\n\t\t<th>Parm Value</th>\n\t\t<th>Description</th>\n\t</tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Do nothing</td>\n    <td>\"0\"</td>\n\t<td>This value (or the absence of this parm from the XML) will cause no change to whether Signature verification will occur or for which applications.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Do not verify app signature</td>\n    <td>\"1\"</td>\n\t<td>This value will cause Signature verification to be turned off, thus causing Package Names alone to be used in to determine if an application is on the \"white\" list.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Verify user app signature</td>\n    <td>\"2\"</td>\n\t<td>This value will cause Signature verification to be turned on, thus causing Signature verification to be used in addition to Package Names to determine if a user, or \"installable\", application is on the \"white\" list.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Verify all apps signature</td>\n    <td>\"3\"</td>\n\t<td>This value will cause Signature verification to be turned on, thus causing Signature verification to be used in addition to Package Names to determine if any application, \"built-in\" or \"installable\", is on the \"white\" list.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</div>\t\n\n### Delete Packages\nSettable if: The Operation Mode is \"Single User With Whitelist\"\n\nPivotal parm: Yes\n\nDescription: \n\n>Select whether or not to delete Packages from the Whitelist\n\n<div class=\"parm-table\">\n <table class=\"table\">\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<th>Parm Option Name</th>\n\t\t<th>Parm Value</th>\n\t\t<th>Description</th>\n\t</tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Delete NO Packages</td>\n    <td>\"0\"</td>\n\t<td>This value does not delete anything and hence does not affect the \"white\" list at all.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Delete specified Packages(s)</td>\n    <td>\"1\"</td>\n\t<td>This value will cause one or more selected Package Names to be deleted from the \"white list\", thus blocking user, or \"installable\", applications with those Package Names from being installed by the device user or launched.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Delete ALL Packages</td>\n    <td>\"2\"</td>\n\t<td>This value will cause all Package Names to be deleted from the \"white list\", thus blocking all user, or \"installable\",  applications from being installed by the device user or launched.</td>\n  </tr>  \n  <tr>\n    <td>Delete specified Signature(s)</td>\n    <td>\"3\"</td>\n\t<td>This value is meaningful only with Signature verification is turned on, in which case it deletes one or more Signatures from the \"white list\", thus blocking user, or \"installable\", applications with those Signatures from being installed by the device user or launched.</td>\n  </tr>  \n</table>\n</div>\t\n\n#### Delete Package Name(s)\nSettable if: The Operation Mode is \"Single User With Whitelist\" *AND* Delete Packages is \"Delete specified Packages(s)\"\n\nPivotal parm: No\n\nParm name: DeletePackageNames\n\nDescription: \n\n>Provide the Package Names to be deleted from the \"white\" list.\n\nParm value input rules: \n\n* String with a minimum size of 1 character\n* Package names must be separated by commas, such as \"com.mycompany.mypackage,com.mycompany2.mypackage2\" \n\n#### Delete Package Signature(s)\nSettable if: Delete Packages is \"Delete specified Signature(s)\" *AND* the Application Verification Signing Mode is \"Do not verify app signature\", \"Verify user app signature\", or \"Verify all apps signature\"\n\nPivotal parm: No\n\nParm name: DeletePackageSign\n\nDescription: \n\n>Provide the package signatures to be deleted. \n\nParm value input rules: \n\n* String with a minimum size of 1 character\n* The package signatures must be separated by commas\n\n### Add Packages\nSettable if: The Operation Mode is \"Single User With Whitelist\"\n\nPivotal parm: Yes\n\nDescription: \n\n>Select whether or not to add Packages to the \"white\" list.

Collected data can be stored locally on the device and optionally sent to the Cloud. Such data can be used to detect devices that need attention or potentially could be used to detect trends that could allow problems to be prevented through preventative action.\n\nThe AnalyticsMgr Feature Type allows you enable or disable collection of data, in the form of groups of metrics, by the Analytics Engine. It also allows you to control whether collected data is stored on the device or sent to the Cloud, and also provides some control over which data is collected and how often.\n\n### Main Functionality\n \n* Enable or Disable all data collection by the Analytics Engine\n* Control whether data is stored locally on the device or is sent to the Cloud\n* Control which data is collected by groups of metrics:\n\t* WWAN Performance\n\t* WLAN Performance\n\t* Battery and CPU Status\n\t* System Information\n\t* GPS Information\n* Control the frequency of data collection by levels:\n\t* None\n\t* Low\n\t* Medium\n\t* High\n\n##Parameter Notes\n###Analytics Action\nPivotal parm: No\n\nParm name: AnalyticsAction\n\nDescription: \n\n>This parm allows you to enable or disable the collection of data on the device by the Analytics Engine.\n\n<div class=\"parm-table\">\n <table class=\"table\">\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<th>Parm Option Name</th>\n\t\t<th>Parm Value</th>\n\t\t<th>Description</th>\n\t</tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Do not change</td>\n    <td>\"0\"</td>\n\t<td>This value (or the absence of this parm from the XML) will cause no change to whether the Analytics Engine collects data on the device.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Enable</td>\n    <td>\"1\"</td>\n\t<td>This value will cause the Analytics Engine to be enabled and hence to collect data on the device.</td>\n  </tr>  \n  <tr>\n    <td>Disable</td>\n    <td>\"2\"</td>\n\t<td>This value will cause the Analytics Engine to be disabled and hence to not collect data on the device.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</div>\t\n\n###Transport Method\nPivotal parm: No\n\nParm name: TransportMethod\n\nDescription: \n\n>This parm allows you to control whether data collected by the Analytics Engine is stored on the device or sent to the Cloud.\n\n<div class=\"parm-table\">\n <table class=\"table\">\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<th>Parm Option Name</th>\n\t\t<th>Parm Value</th>\n\t\t<th>Description</th>\n\t</tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Do not change</td>\n    <td>\"0\"</td>\n\t<td>This value (or the absence of this parm from the XML) will cause no change to whether data is stored on the device or sent to the Cloud by the Analytics Engine.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Select Cloud Transport</td>\n    <td>\"1\"</td>\n\t<td>This value will cause the Analytics Engine to send data to the Cloud.

Also, previously selected settings would be retained on the device. For example, the Analytics CSP could be used to collect WWAN Performance metrics and the other groups could be set to \"Do not change\". Then at another time, the CSP could be used to collect WLAN Performance metrics and the other groups could be set to \"Do not change\".

Feature Compatibility\n\n<iframe src=\"compare.html#mx=4.3&csp=AnalyticsMgr&os=JB&embed=true\"></iframe> "},{"key":"guide-csp-app","name":" AppMgr","md":"# AppMgr\n\n## About AppMgr\n\n### Overview\n\nThe AppMgr Feature Type allows you manage the set of user applications that are installed on the device. On consumer Android devices, application management requires a device user to interact with UI presented on the device. In scenarios where a device is being managed by an MDM, it is often important for the MDM to tightly control which user applications are installed, without the need to involve a device user and without the consent or approval of a device user. The primary purpose of the AppMgr Feature Type is to manage user applications programmatically and silently. This enables an MDM to take full control of the set of user applications that are installed on the device.\n\nThe AppMgr Feature Type allows you to Install, Uninstall, Upgrade, and Turn On and Off the launching of applications. It also allows you to designate an application as the Default Launcher, which is the application that is invoked when the device user presses the HOME Key, and perform other tasks related to the management of applications.\n\nWhen considering the capabilities of the AppMgr Feature Type, it is important to understand that applications can be divided into two classes: System applications and User applications. System applications are those applications that are built-into the device and hence are always installed. User applications are those applications that are not built-into the device and hence must be installed onto a device before they can be used. Some functions of the AppMgr Feature Type apply only to System applications, some apply only to User applications, and some apply to both. Each function will identify the classes of applications to which it applies.\n\n### Main Functionality\n\n* Install, Uninstall, and Upgrade User applications (with no device user involvement)\n* Set an application to be the Default Launcher\n* Turn On and Off the Launching of an application (Blacklisting)\n* Clear the Recent Application List\n* Enable and Disable Access to Application Info\n\n##Parameter Notes\n### Action\nPivotal parm: Yes\n\nDescription: \n\n>Specify the application action to perform.\n\n<div class=\"parm-table\">\n <table class=\"table\">\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<th>Parm Option Name</th>\n\t\t<th>Parm Value</th>\n\t\t<th>Description</th>\n\t</tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Do nothing</td>\n    <td>\"Do nothing\"</td>\n\t<td>This value (or the absence of this parm from the XML) will not make any change to the applications on the device.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Install</td>\n    <td>\"Install\"</td>\n\t<td>This value will cause a User application contained within an APK file in the specified path on the device to be Installed on the device.

This allows the new version of the application to access (and possibly convert) data created by the old version.</p>\n\n\t<p><b>Note:</b>  In devices running the Jelly Bean version of Android, an Upgrade can replace any version of an application with any other version of the same application. However, in devices running the KitKat or higher version of Android, an Upgrade can only replace an application with a higher (numerically greater) version of the same application. This change was made to reduce issues where an older version of an application maybe unable to understand data produced by a newer version.</p>\n\t</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Set as Default Launcher</td>\n    <td>\"SetDefaultLauncher\"</td>\n\t<td>This value will cause the application with the specified Package Name to be made the new Default Launcher.

But an APK could be used to Upgrade either a System application or a User application. In order for any Upgrade to work, the APK file must be signed with the same developer certificate as the application it is trying to replace. If the APK file is not signed with the same developer certificate then an error will be returned in the Result XML document. This means that a System application can only be replaced using an APK file produced by the same developer that produced the built-in System application. If a System application is successfully Upgraded using an APK, the new version of the application is granted the same permissions as the version that was replaced. This allows the new version of the application to successfully perform the same operations as the original System application even though it is actually a User application. Since the new version is not built-into the device the device will revert to the old built-in version of the application whenever data is cleared.\n\nParm value input rules: \n\n* String containing the full path and name of an APK that resides on the device. For example, '/storage/sdcard1/Herald.apk'.\n* The minimum length is 1 character and the maximum length is 255 characters\n\n####Package Name\nSettable if: The Action is \"Uninstall\", \"Set as Default Launcher\", \"Enable Application\", or \"Disable Application\"\n\n**Note:** To perform the above listed Actions on an application, the Package Name of that application must be known and specified. The Package Name can be acquired from the application developer, by looking up the Package Name on a device, or using developer tools to extract the Package Name from the APK file.\n\nPivotal parm: No\n\nParm name: Package\n\nDescription: \n\n>Provide the Package Name of the application for the application action.\n\nParm value input rules: \n\n* String containing the valid name of the package. For example, 'com.mycompany.mypackage'.\n* The minimum length is 1 character and the maximum length is 255 characters\n* The package names must be separated by commas\n\n### Protected List Action\nPivotal parm: Yes\n\nDescription: \n\n>The Protected List is a feature that allows certain applications to be exempted from certain constraints that are imposed on applications when Multi-User Mode is enabled. In particular, applications whose Package Names are on the Protected List will:\n\n>* Be allowed to launch when no device user is logged in\n>* Not be terminated when a device user logs out\n>* Have only one copy of its data for all users, even if Multi-User Data Separation is enabled\n\n>**Note:** Multi-User Mode is supported on all Zebra Android devices that support Zebra MX functionality, but the AccessMgr Feature Type currently does not support enabling Multi-User Mode. Multi-User Mode can be enabled on devices that support it, but only using unsupported tools or mechanisms that do not scale to large deployments. For this reason, the ability to use the AppMgr Feature Type to manage the Protected List may provide little or no immediate benefit. In the future, when the AccessMgr Feature Type is enhanced to support enabling Multi-User Mode, the ability to use the AppMgr Feature Type to manage the Protected List will likely be more meaningful.\n\n<div class=\"parm-table\">\n <table class=\"table\">\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<th>Parm Option Name</th>\n\t\t<th>Parm Value</th>\n\t\t<th>Description</th>\n\t</tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Do nothing</td>\n    <td>\"Do nothing\"</td>\n\t<td>This value (or the absence of this parm from the XML) will not cause any changes to the Protected List.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Add Application to Protected List</td>\n    <td>\"AddAppToProtectedList\"</td>\n\t<td>This value will cause the Package Name of an application to be Added to the Protected List.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Remove Application from Protected List</td>\n    <td>\"RemoveAppFromProtectedList\"</td>\n\t<td>This value will cause the Package Name of an application to be Removed from the Protected List.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Remove All Application from Protected List</td>\n    <td>\"ClearProtectedList\"</td>\n\t<td>This value will cause all Package Names to be Removed from the Protected List.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</div>\t\n\n####Package Name\nSettable if: The Protected List Action is \"Add Application to Protected List\" or \"Remove Application from Protected List\"\n\nPivotal parm: No\n\nParm name: ProtectedListPackage\n\nDescription: \n\n>Provide the Package Name of the application that should be Added to or Removed from the Protected List.\n\nParm value input rules: \n\n* String containing the valid name of the package. For example, 'com.mycompany.mypackage'.\n* The minimum length is 1 character and the maximum length is 255 characters\n* The package names must be separated by commas\n\n### Access to App Info Action\n\nPivotal parm: No\n\nParm name: AccessAppInfoAction\n\nDescription: \n\n>Since the AppMgr Feature Type allows control of which applications are installed, it may be of concern that a device user can use the App Info section of the in-device System Settings Menu to impact an installed application.  A device user might terminate an application (Force Stop), remove application data (Clear Data), etc.  A device user might also Uninstall the application completely.  If an MDM is being used to tightly control the set of installed applications on a device, such activities by a device user might be undesirable.\n\n>This may be compounded by the fact that the App Info section of the System Settings Menu may be reached from a variety of places in the device UI, not just from the main System Settings Menu.  For example, App Info can be reached for an application from the Android Recent Applications List or from a notification related to the application in the Android Notification Area.\n\n>To prevent device users from using App Info to alter the configured set of installed applications, it may be desirable to prevent the device user from accessing App Info altogether.  Of course, you could use the AppMgr Feature Type to disable launching of the System Settings Menu application, which would prevent access to App Info.  But that would also prevent access to all other aspects of the System Settings Menu.  A more targeted approach would be to block only App Info.\n\n>This allows you to enable or disable all access to App Info for all applications without blocking access to other parts of the System Settings Menu.  By disabling App Info, you can prevent the device user from getting to App Info and using it to interfere with the configured set of installed applications.\n\n>**Note:** This parm is supported only on devices that are running the Kit Kat version of Android.  This is because this parm depends on modifications made to the System Settings Menu application, and those modifications are found only on Kit Kat devices.\n\n<div class=\"parm-table\">\n <table class=\"table\">\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<th>Parm Option Name</th>\n\t\t<th>Parm Value</th>\n\t\t<th>Description</th>\n\t</tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Do nothing</td>\n    <td>\"Do nothing\"</td>\n\t<td>This value (or the absence of this parm from the XML) will cause no changes to be made.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Enable Access to App Info for all applications</td>\n    <td>\"EnableAccessAllInfo\"</td>\n\t<td>This value will cause access to App Info to be enabled if access to the System Settings Menu application is enabled.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Disable Access to App Info for all applications</td>\n    <td>\"DisableAccessAllInfo\"</td>\n\t<td>This value will cause all access to App Info to be disabled.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</div>\t\n\n\n## Example XML\n###Install An Application\n\t:::xml\n\t<!-- Silently install Clock.apk from the /enterprise/usr/persist folder -->\n\t<wap-provisioningdoc>\n\t\t<characteristic version=\"4.2\" type=\"AppMgr\">\n\t\t\t<parm name=\"Action\" value=\"Install\" />\n\t\t\t<parm name=\"APK\" value=\"/enterprise/usr/persist/Clock.apk\" />\n\t\t</characteristic>\n\t</wap-provisioningdoc>\n\n\n###Upgrade An Application\n\t:::xml\n\t<!-- Silently upgrade Clock.apk from the /enterprise/usr/persist folder -->\n\t<wap-provisioningdoc>\n\t\t<characteristic type=\"AppMgr\" version=\"4.2\" >\n\t\t\t<parm name=\"Action\" value=\"Upgrade\"/>\n\t\t\t<parm name=\"APK\" value=\"/enterprise/usr/persist/Clock.apk\"/>\n\t\t</characteristic>\n\t</wap-provisioningdoc>\n\n###Disable An Application\n\t:::XML\n\t<wap-provisioningdoc>\n\t\t<characteristic version=\"4.2\" type=\"AppMgr\">\n\t\t\t<parm name=\"Action\" value=\"DisableApplication\" />\n\t\t\t<parm name=\"Package\" value=\"com.mypackagename\" />\n\t\t</characteristic>\n\t</wap-provisioningdoc>\n\n###Uninstall An Application\n\t:::XML\n\t<wap-provisioningdoc>\n\t\t<characteristic version=\"4.2\" type=\"AppMgr\">\n\t\t\t<parm name=\"Action\" value=\"Uninstall\" />\n\t\t\t<parm name=\"Package\" value=\"com.packagename\" />\n\t\t</characteristic>\n\t</wap-provisioningdoc>\n\n###Start An Application After Installing it\n\t:::XML\n\t<wap-provisioningdoc>\n\t\t<characteristic version=\"4.2\" type=\"AppMgr\">\n\t\t\t<parm name=\"Action\" value=\"Install\" />\n\t\t\t<parm name=\"APK\" value=\"/sdcard/myapp.apk\" />\n\t\t</characteristic>\n\t\t<characteristic version=\"4.3\" type=\"Intent\">\n\t\t\t<parm name=\"Action\" value=\"StartActivity\" />\n\t\t\t<parm name=\"ActionName\" value=\"android.intent.action.MAIN\" />\n\t\t\t<parm name=\"Package\" value=\"com.mypackage\" />\n\t\t\t<parm name=\"Class\" value=\"com.mypackage.myactivity\" />\n\t\t</characteristic>\n\t</wap-provisioningdoc>\n\n\t\n## Feature Compatibility\n\n<iframe src=\"compare.html#mx=4.3&csp=AppMgr&os=JB&embed=true\"></iframe> "},{"key":"guide-csp-audiovoluimgr","name":" AudioVolUIMgr","md":"# AudioVolUIMgr\n\n## About AudioVolUIMgr\n\n### Overview\nMany Zebra Android devices contains a Zebra Audio Volume Control UI (ZVC) that allows a device user to adjust the volumes of various Audio Streams in the device. An Audio Stream is a channel via which audio can generated and physically output (e.g. to a speaker, headset, etc.). The number of Audio Streams that can be supported by an Android device is generally fixed. But the number of possible purposes for which audio could be generated is theoretically unlimited. As a result, a particular Audio Stream might be used for a purpose other than that for which that Audio Stream is normally used in Android or a given Audio Stream might need to be used for multiple purposes.\n\nThe standard Android Audio Volume Control UI identifies each Audio Stream that can be controlled in a fixed manner that is predefined for each Audio Stream. Such identification might or might not accurately reflect the actual purposes for which a given Audio Stream is being used. This can produce a less than optimal user experience since the device user might change the volume of an Audio Stream without realizing what it might affect.\n\nThe ZVC allows configuration of the manner in which Audio Streams are identified to the device user, thus allowing the user experience to be customized. The ZVC also provides even more control over the user experience by allowing configuration of the minimum, maximum, and preset values for a given Audio Stream. For example, the minimum volume for an Audio Stream could be set greater than zero to prevent a device user from turning it off completely and potentially missing important audio notifications that are performed on that Audio Stream.\n\nThe ZVC also provides support for Audio Profiles which define different scenarios or use cases in which one or more Audio Streams can be used. Each Audio Profile can configure the behavior of ZVC for some or all of the available Audio Streams. By selecting a defined Audio Profile, the configuration of ZVC for multiple Audio Streams can be configured in a single operation. For example, there might be one Audio Profile for working in a quiet office and another for working in a noisy warehouse.\n\nThe AudioVolUIMgr Feature Type allows you to add, delete, and replace Audio Profiles and to select the current Audio Profile that will be in effect on the device. It also allows you to modify the \"Factory Preset\" Audio Profile, which cannot be deleted. The AudioVolUIMgr Feature Type also allows you to directly control the Mute and Vibrate states of the device, which are independent of all Audio Streams and Audio Profiles.\n\nThe ZVC can be invoked by a device user by pressing the physical volume control buttons on a device (when available) or by selecting the Sound->Volumes screen from the Android System Settings Menu. The UI presented by the ZVC when it is invoked by the device user will be determined based on the most recent configuration applied to ZVC using the AudioVolUIMgr Feature Type, in particular the set of defined Audio Profiles and the currently selected Audio Profile. The following Audio Streams are supported:\n\n* STREAM_MUSIC - The Android audio stream typically used for music playback.\n* STREAM_RING - The Android audio stream typically used for the incoming call notification.\n* STREAM_NOTIFICATION - The Android audio stream typically used for other notifications.\n* STREAM_SYSTEM - The Android audio stream for typically used by system sounds.\n* STREAM_ALARM - The Android audio stream typically used for alarms.\n* STREAM_VOICE_CALL - The Android audio stream typically used for phone calls.\n* Decode Beep Virtual Volume Scale - This is a special stream used on Zebra devices to produce an audible notification for barcode scanning.\n\nAn Audio Profile can be defined to configure the following settings for any or all of the above Audio Streams:\n\n* Label - The text label. This will be displayed by the ZVC to visually identify the Audio Stream to the device user.\n* Icon - The graphical icon. This will be displayed by the ZVC to visually identify the Audio Stream to the device user.\n* Visibility - This will control whether the ZVC will allow the device user to view and modify the volume settings for the Audio Stream. For example, this could be used to prevent a device user from making any changes to the volume of the Audio Stream used for incoming call notification.\n\nAn Audio Profile can also configure the volume levels for each of four audio modes: Speaker, Receiver, Wired headset, and Bluetooth headset. The specified modes are determined based on the physical output path to which an Audio Stream is directed. For each mode, the following volume levels can be specified.\n\n* Minimum volume level - This will cause the ZVC to prevent a device user from changing the volume of the Audio Stream to a value that is below the specified value. For example, this could be used to prevent the user from setting the Audio Stream used for notifications too low in noisy environments.\n* Maximum volume level - This will cause the ZVC to prevent a device user from changing the volume of the Audio Stream to a value that is above the specified value. For example, this could be used to prevent the user from setting the Audio Stream used for music playback too high in quiet environments.\n* Preset volume level - This will cause the ZVC to set the volume of the Audio Stream to the specified value when this Audio Profile becomes selected as the current Audio Profile.\n\n>**Note:** The ZVC is only available on selected Zebra Android devices running the Kit Kat version of Android, as listed in the Feature Compatibility table.

Regular batteries provide only basic support for battery level. Smart Batteries add capabilities to identify batteries uniquely and to track battery provenance and usage history. Gifted Batteries add capabilities that can be used to provide more accurate gas gauging, monitor battery charging, and track battery health.\n\nA key capability that is lacking for Regular batteries but is provided for both Smart and Gifted Batteries is the ability to determine when a battery is nearing the end of its useful lifetime and needs to be decommissioned (replaced). In the case of Smart Batteries, decommissioning must be based strictly on the charge history of the device. In the case of Gifted Batteries, which have more robust capabilities to track battery health, decommissioning can be based on the actual condition of the battery. In either case, the determination of when a battery needs to be decommissioned is configurable, to account for different demands that are likely to be placed batteries in different environments.\n\nThe BatteryMgr Feature Type allows you to configure the thresholds that will be used to determine when a battery needs to be decommissioned. These values, once configured, will be used by battery management software, along with other battery parameters, to determine the value of the decommission flag that will be stored in, and that will thereafter be carried with, a Smart or Gifted Battery.\n\nThe supported thresholds are:\n\n* Battery Usage Decommission Threshold\n\t* A battery is considered to be decommissioned if the battery usage number is greater than or equal to Battery Usage Decommission Threshold.\n\t* Battery Usage Decommission Threshold is applicable for Smart Batteries, TC50 batteries, and TC75 batteries.\n\t* **Note:** Battery usage number is Aggregatecharge/RatedCapacity of the battery.\n* Percent Decommission Threshold\n\t* A battery is considered to be decommissioned if the Health percentage of the battery is less than or equal to Percent Decommission Threshold.\n\t* Percent Decommission Threshold is applicable for Gifted Batteries.\n\t* **Note:** Health percentage is the ratio of \"present_capacity\" to \"design_capacity\" at a discharge rate of \"design_capacity\".\n\nThe values that are set for the threshold values are persisted across reboots by the use of shared preferences which will save the configuration data. The configured threshold values will also be persisted across an enterprise reset.\n\nAn error will be reported if the OS does not support the battery decommission feature, which will be determined by whether or not the syfs files, either batteryusage_decommission_threshold or percent_decommission_threshold, are present on the device.\n\n### Main Functionality\n \n* Set the Battery Usage Decommission Threshold for Smart Batteries\n* Set the Battery Percentage Decommission Threshold Gifted Batteries\n\n##Parameter Notes\n###Battery Usage Decommissioned Threshold\nPivotal parm: No\n\nParm name: SetBatteryUsageDecommissionThreshold\n\nDescription: \n\n>This parm allows you to set the Battery Usage Decommissioned Threshold on devices that have support for Smart Batteries.\n\n>Smart Batteries accumulate the total amount of charge that is placed into the battery over time. This accumulation is referred to as Aggregated Charge. Over time, the Aggregated Charge will grow, and it is a reasonable expectation that a battery with a larger Aggregated Charge has a shorter remaining useful lifetime than a device with a smaller Aggregated Charge.\n\n>Dividing the Aggregated Charge of a Smart Battery by its Rated Capacity results in what is called the Battery Usage Number. The Battery Usage Number is stored in the battery and can be used to approximate (pro-rate) the number of \"full discharge/charge\" cycles that battery has undergone. This can only be an approximation since in most cases the device will have actually experienced only partial discharge/charge cycles.\n\n>A Smart Battery is considered to be ready to be decommissioned if the Battery Usage Number is greater than or equal to the currently configured Battery Usage Decommissioned Threshold. The default value for the Battery Usage Decommissioned Threshold is 400, indicating that a Smart Battery should be decommissioned once it has undergone an approximate of 400 \"full discharge/charge\" cycles.\n\n>**Note:** This parm can be used on a Zebra Android device that has the ability to support Smart Batteries, whether or not a Smart Battery is currently present in the device. For example, a device could support both Regular and Smart Batteries. In such a case, this parm could be used to configure how the device will handle a Smart Battery in the future, should one be inserted, even if the device currently has a Regular Battery inserted. If this parm is on a device that does not support Smart Batteries, then an error will be returned in the Result XML document.\n\nParm value input rules: \n\n* The input value must be an integer between 0 and 65535\n* Setting this parm to 0 (or the absence of this parm from the XML) indicates no change or not applicable\n\n###Battery Percentage Decommissioned Threshold\nPivotal parm: No\n\nParm name: SetPercentDecommissionThreshold\n\nDescription: \n\n>This parm allows you to set the Battery Percentage Decommissioned Threshold on devices that have support for Gifted Batteries.\n\n>Gifted Batteries have the ability to determine their Actual Capacity under specific discharge conditions. Based on this, Gifted Batteries can estimate their Battery Health as the percentage the Actual Capacity is of the Rated Capacity. Over time, both the Actual Capacity and the Battery Health will reduce and it is a reasonable expectation that a battery with a lower Battery Health has a shorter remaining useful lifetime than a device with a larger Battery Health.\n\n>A Gifted Battery is considered to be ready to be decommissioned if the Battery Health is less than the currently configured Battery Percentage Decommissioned Threshold. The default value for the Battery Percentage Decommissioned Threshold is 75, indicating that a Smart Battery should be decommissioned once its Actual Capacity is less than 75% of its original Rated Capacity.\n\n>**Note:** This parm can be used on a Zebra Android device that has the ability to support Gifted Batteries, whether or not a Gifted Battery is currently present in the device. For example, a device could support both Smart and Gifted Batteries. In such a case, this parm could be used to configure how the device will handle a Gifted Battery in the future, should one be inserted, even if the device currently has a Smart Battery inserted. If this parm is on a device that does not support Gifted Batteries, then an error will be returned in the Result XML document.\n\nParm value input rules: \n\n* The input value must be an integer between 0 and 100\n* Setting this parm to 0 (or the absence of this parm from the XML) indicates no change or not applicable\n\n## Feature Compatibility\n\n<iframe src=\"compare.html#mx=4.3&csp=BatteryMgr&os=JB&embed=true\"></iframe> "},{"key":"guide-csp-browser","name":" BrowserMgr","md":"# BrowserMgr\n\n## About BrowserMgr\n\n### Overview\n\nMany Zebra Android devices include a default Web Browser that is derived from the stock Android Open Source Project (AOSP) Web Browser source code. The key changes made are to enable configurability of selected settings. The BrowserMgr Feature Type is used to configure these settings.\n\n**Note:** Multi-User Mode is supported on all Zebra Android devices that support Zebra MX functionality, but the AccessMgr Feature Type currently does not support enabling Multi-User Mode. Multi-User Mode can be enabled on devices that support it, but only using unsupported tools or mechanisms that do not scale to large deployments. For this reason, the ability to use the AppMgr Feature Type to manage the Protected List may provide little or no immediate benefit. In the future, when the AccessMgr Feature Type is enhanced to support enabling Multi-User Mode, the ability to use the AppMgr Feature Type to manage the Protected List will likely be more meaningful.\n\n### Main Functionality\n\n* Set the Default Home Page\n* Turn the Remember Passwords Option On/Off \n* Turn the Save Form Data Option On/Off \n\n##Parameter Notes\n###Set Default Home Page\nPivotal parm: No\n\nParm name: SetDefaultHomepage\n\nDescription: \n\n>This parm allows you to set the Default Home Page URI of the Default Android Web Browser.

Some Zebra Android devices may also be equipped with special-purpose mechanisms, such as lasers or imagers, which are optimized to scan barcodes. In some sensitive environments, it may be necessary to restrict the use of devices from taking pictures or capturing documents to avoid potential security risks.\n\nThe CameraMgr Feature Type allows you to control which of the mechanisms supported by a device can be used by the device user to take pictures or capture documents, and hence are considered to be cameras. For example you could prevent the device user from using all cameras on the device or selectively control which cameras the device user can use.\n\n**Note:** If a device is equipped with a mechanism that can be used to take pictures or capture documents, then that mechanism will be considered to be a camera, for the purposes of the CameraMgr Feature Type. For example, if a device is equipped with a CCD-based imager that is primarily designed to scan barcodes but also supports the ability to take pictures or capture documents, then that imager will be considered to be a camera and hence will need to support enable and disable. But if no method was available to use that imager to take pictures or capture documents, then it would not be considered a cameras, since it would not introduce the same camera-oriented security risks.\n\n### Main Functionality\n\n* Enable or disable the use of all Cameras\n* Enable or disable the use of the Front Facing Camera\n* Enable or disable the use of the Rear Facing Camera\n\n##Parameter Notes\n###All Cameras\nPivotal parm: Yes\n\nDescription: \n\n>This parm will enable or disable use of all of the cameras that are on the device, which may affect cameras that are not explicitly listed. In other words, this will globally allow or disallow all camera support.\n\n>**Note:** Enabling or disabling all cameras will affect all mechanism that are considered cameras that are supported on a device. This will be the case even if that device has more cameras than can be individually controlled on that device using the CameraMgr Feature Type. For example, if a device had a front facing camera, a rear facing, and a side-facing imager that can capture documents, all three would be considered cameras would be enabled or disabled together. This would be the cases even the side facing imager could not be enabled or disabled individually. Enabling or disabling all cameras may override prior enabling or disabling of individual cameras using the CameraMgr Feature Type or may be overridden for individual cameras by subsequent use of the CameraMgr Feature Type.\n\n<div class=\"parm-table\">\n <table class=\"table\">\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<th>Parm Option Name</th>\n\t\t<th>Parm Value</th>\n\t\t<th>Description</th>\n\t</tr>\n  <tr>\n

Overview\n\nThe CellularMgr Feature Type allows you to control how a device's Cellular data connection is used. The CellularMgr Feature Type is supported only on Zebra Android devices that are equipped with Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN) network adapters that enable access to a Cellular data network.\n\n**Note:** If a device does not have a Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN) network adapter, then it will not support the Cellular data connections and hence will not support the CellularMgr Feature Type. Attempting to use the CellularMgr Feature Type on such a device will cause an error to be returned in the Result XML document.\n\nThe CellularMgr Feature Type provides the ability to change the state of various options On or Off, thus controlling whether the capability is operational. The CellularMgr Feature Type also provides the ability to enable or disable use of the same options. Disabling an option means that the option cannot be turned On or Off by the device user or programmatically, using the CellularMgr Feature Type. Enabling an option means that the option can be turned On or Off by the device user or programmatically, using the CellularMgr Feature Type. You can think of Turn On/Off as being like a switch and the Enable/Disable as being like a cover over the switch. When the cover is closed, the position of the switch cannot be changed.\n\nIn Android, the Data Roaming Option determines whether a device is allowed to communicate over Cellular data networks other than the one provided by its configured \"home\" mobile operator. Communicating over such \"foreign\" networks is called roaming and can be quite convenient, allowing a device user to operate seamlessly in many different locations.  But, depending on the networks involved and the terms of a specific Cellular data service plan, turning on the Data Roaming Option significantly increase telecom expenses. Turning off the Data Roaming Option can help limit such costs but limiting Cellular data connections to the \"home\" network.\n\nIn Android, the Background Data Option determines whether applications that are capable of performing communications in the background (i.e. while they are not the current visible running foreground application) should do so over a Cellular data network. Turning on the Background Data Option allows background communications over a Cellular data network and can improve the experience of the device user by allowing applications to have data ready \"when you ask for it\". For example, an email application might download emails while the device user is using another application or when the device's screen is turned off. Turning off the Background Data Option tells applications to utilize Cellular data connections only when running in the foreground.\n\n### Main Functionality\n\n* Enable or disable Data Roaming\n*

A Keystore must exist on the device before installing or uninstalling certificates. \n\n<div class=\"parm-table\">\n <table class=\"table\">\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<th>Parm Option Name</th>\n\t\t<th>Parm Value</th>\n\t\t<th>Description</th>\n\t</tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Install certificate</td>\n    <td>\"1\"</td>\n\t<td>This value will cause a specified certificate to be installed on the device.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Uninstall certificate</td>\n    <td>\"2\"</td>\n\t<td>This value will cause a specified certificate to be uninstalled from the device.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Initialize Android Keystore</td>\n    <td>\"4\"</td>\n\t<td>This value will cause a new Android Keystore to be initialized.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</div>\t\n\n###Certificate Alias\nSettable if: The Certificate Action is \"Install certificate\" or \"Uninstall certificate\"\n\nPivotal parm: No\n\nParm name: CertAlias\n\nDescription: \n\n>This parm is used to provide the name (alias) that will uniquely identify the certificate. \n\n>When installing a certificate, the old certificate with same alias name will be replaced by the new certificate.\n\n>When uninstalling a certificate, the Keystore or trusted CA store will be searched for a record with the same alias name. If the record is found, it removes the Keystore or trusted CA store. \n\nParm value input rules: \n\n* String with a minimum size of 1 character\n\n#### Alias Handling Issues\nDue to current limitations of the Certificate Manager Feature (in an EAP-TLS scenario), it is not possible to \"override\" the Alias that is assigned to a Client Certificate and Private Key when they are installed into the Android KeyStore\n\nThe only way to determine the actual Alias that is assigned to a Client Certificate and Private Key when they are installed into the Android KeyStore is to examine the Android Keystore after installation to determine which Alias was used:\n\n1. The same Alias will ALWAYS be assigned to a given Client Certificate and Private Key, no matter when, or on which device, it is installed\n\n2. Whenever a different Client Certificate is used, a different Alias will generally be assigned to the Client Certificate and Private Key\n\n#### Manually Determining the Certificate Alias\nA device can be used to capture the alias being used for the certificate being installed. It is recommended that the Keystore be cleared before performing these steps (Settings->Security->Clear Credentials)\n\n1. Use Certificate Manager to install the certificate onto a device.\n2. Navigate to Settings->Wi-Fi->'+'' to add a network\n3. Scroll to security, tap and select 802.1x EAP\n4. Scroll to EAP method, tap and select TLS\n5. Scroll to client certificate, tap and note a drop down box with \"(unspecified)\" and the alias of the installed certificate. The alias listed can become the value to use as the certificate when using WiFiConfig to configure a profile that uses EAP-TLS.\n\n###Certificate Type\nSettable if: The Certificate Action is \"Install certificate\"\n\nPivotal parm: Yes\n\nDescription: \n\n>This parm is used to specify the type of certificate to be installed.\n\n>**Note:** Be sure to initialize the Keystore the first time when installing certificate types with private keys (.PFX,.P12,.PKCS12)\n\n<div class=\"parm-table\">\n <table class=\"table\">\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<th>Parm Option Name</th>\n\t\t<th>Parm Value</th>\n\t\t<th>Description</th>\n\t</tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>CA Certificate (.PEM file)</td>\n    <td>\"5\"</td>\n\t<td></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Client Certificate (.PEM file)</td>\n    <td>\"6\"</td>\n\t<td></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Client Certificate and Private Key (.PFX file)</td>\n    <td>\"8\"</td>\n\t<td></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Client Certificate and Private Key (.P12 file)</td>\n    <td>\"9\"</td>\n\t<td></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Client Certificate and Private Key (.PKCS12 file)</td>\n    <td>\"10\"</td>\n\t<td></td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</div>\t\n\n###Certificate Method\nSettable if: The Certificate Action is \"Install certificate\"\n\nPivotal parm: Yes\n\nDescription: \n\n>This parm is used to specify the method to use to install the certificate.\n\n<div class=\"parm-table\">\n <table class=\"table\">\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<th>Parm Option Name</th>\n\t\t<th>Parm Value</th>\n\t\t<th>Description</th>\n\t</tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Reference certificate file</td>\n    <td>\"2\"</td>\n\t<td>This value indicates that the file must exist on the device that contains the certificate data.</td>\n  </tr>\n  </table>\n</div>\t\n\n###Certificate File\nPivotal parm: No \n\nDescription: \n\n>This parm is used to provide the path and name of the (in-device) file containing the desired certificate data.

To avoid complications related to LTC, all Date and Time values used by the Clock Feature Type must be represented as UTC.\n\nUsing UTC reduce complexity and ensures a deterministic result when setting the Date and Time, regardless of the configured Time Zone or any Daylight Saving Time offset that might apply. For example, if the Date and Time were set in LTC, then the order of setting Date, Time, and Time Zone could affect the actual results. Also, if LTC were used, then certain combinations would become invalid such as the times \"skipped\" during adjustment for Daylight Saving Time.\n\n### Main Functionality\n\n* Turn Auto Time On or Off\n* Set the Time Zone\n* Set the current Date\n* Set the current Time\n* Set the Auto Time NTP Server Address\n* Set the Auto Time Sync Interval\n\n##Parameter Notes\n### AutoTime\nPivotal parm: Yes\n\nDescription: \n\n>This parm allows you to control whether the Date and Time on the device should be set automatically or manually.\n\n>When AutoTime is turned On, the time will be acquired automatically, if possible.

State allows you to control whether the subsystem is On (active) or Off (inactive). Usage allows you to control (enable or disable) whether the state of a subsystem can be changed (turned On or Off) by the device user using the System Settings Menu or programmatically using the ComponentMgr Feature Type. If you try to use the ComponentMgr Feature Type to control the state of a subsystem for which usage is currently disabled, then an error will be returned in the Result XML document.\n\n>**Note:** Not every device will support every subsystem.

Most Feature Types are used to accomplish some specific purpose and a failure generally indicates that the desired operation could not be performed. The ConditionMgr Feature Type allows you to check selected Conditions and cause a failure if they do or do not exist on the device.\n\nTo understand how to use the ConditionMgr Feature Type, it is important to understand how error handling works in the MXMS.  This is explained in more detail in the XmlMgr Feature Type.\n\nThe ConditionMgr Feature Type is designed to create failures. As such, it cannot deliver full value when it is used with the Default Error-Handling Mode since the failure would just be reported, but would not stop execution. To gain full value from the ConditionMgr Feature Type, the \"Execute until error, then stop\" Error Handling Mode should be used. A common use case for the ConditionMgr Feature Type is to check for some Condition at the start of a sequence of Features that indicates that those Features cannot or should not be executed, and hence to stop executing immediately and thereby avoid executing those Features. The ConditionMgr Feature Type results in a failure, the ConditionMgr Feature Type allows control over what failure is reported, thus assisting with troubleshooting the source of the failure.\n\nThe ConditionMgr Feature Type can handle situations where the Condition to be tested may not happen immediately, such as when a device user must perform some action.  To handle such cases, the Condition test can be repeated until the desired state has been reached or until a specified number of retries has been exhausted.  To handle cases where the desired Condition may require device user action, the ConditionMgr Feature Type allows collaboration with the StatusMgr Feature Type to provide a message to notify the device user of the need for action.\n\n### Main Functionality\n* Test for a Condition and return failure if the specified Condition is met or not met\n\t* Only currently supported Condition is \"Have any valid IP Address\"\n* Specify a failure message to return for a failure\n* Retry up to a specified number of tries, with a specified delay between tries\n* Specify a waiting status message to display (via StatusMgr) while trying/retrying\n\n\n##Parameter Notes\n###Data Type\nPivotal parm: Yes\n\nDescription: \n\n>This parm allows you to select the Data Type of the Condition you want to Test.\n\n<div class=\"parm-table\">\n <table class=\"table\">\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<th>Parm Option Name</th>\n\t\t<th>Parm Value</th>\n\t\t<th>Description</th>\n\t</tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Boolean</td>\n    <td>\"1\"</td>\n\t<td>This value will set the Data Type of the Condition to test to be Boolean.

For example, a failure to acquire a valid IP Address [via Ethernet] within a specified amount of time might use a message such as \"Ethernet connectivity not established before timeout\". Such a message could be invaluable when troubleshooting later as it clearly defines why the Feature failed and could be used to determine appropriate corrective action. If an empty (length of zero) value is specified, then no message will be included in the characteristic-error tag.\n\nParm value input rules: \n\n* String with a maximum size of 250 characters\n\n###Condition Wait Message\nSettable if: The Condition Met Action is \"Retry (up to specified times) then Fail\" OR the Condition Not Met Action is \"Retry (up to specified times) then Fail\"\n\nPivotal parm: No\n\nParm name: ConditionWaitMessage\n\nDescription: \n\n>This parm allows you to specify the message that should be sent to the device user, using the StatusMgr Feature Type, to indicate that the ConditionMgr is waiting for the Test defined for the Condition to reach a defined state or for the specified number of retries to be exhausted.  Since this message is intended to notify the device user that an action should be taken, it should be worded to communicate to such users.  In particular, it may need to in a particular language. The message should ideally indicate what the Condition is waiting for and/or what action the user should take or not take and what such action will cause.  It may also be useful to communicate the amount of time the user has to take the action before failure will occur. For example, a message indicating a wait for a valid IP Address [via Ethernet] within a specified amount of time might use a message such as \"Please insert device into an Ethernet cradle within 2 minutes\". If an empty (length of zero) value is specified, then no message will be sent to StatusMgr.\n\n>**Note:** A wait message may or may not be made visible to the device user, depending on whether or not there is an application actively listening for and displaying messages sent to StatusMgr.\n\nParm value input rules: \n\n* String with a maximum of 250 characters\n\n##Example XML\n###Use with XmlMgr\n\nFor best results, ConditionMgr and XmlMgr should be used together. For example, to accomplish the \"Ethernet Scan and Dock\" use case, the following Request XML Document might be used:\n\n\t:::XML\n\t<wap-provisioningdoc>\n\t\t<characteristic version=\"4.2\" type=\"XmlMgr\">\n\t\t\t<parm name=\"ProcessingMode\" value=\"2\"/>\n\t\t</characteristic>\n\t\t<characteristic version=\"4.4\" type=\"ComponentMgr\">\n\t\t\t<parm name=\" EthernetState\" value=\"1\"/>\n\t\t</characteristic>\n\t\t<characteristic version=\"4.4\" type=\"ConditionMgr\">\n\t\t\t<parm name=\"DataType\" value=\"1\"/>\n\t\t\t<characteristic type=\"BooleanDetails\">\n\t\t\t\t<parm name=\"BooleanSourceType\" value=\"2\"/>\n\t\t\t\t<parm name=\"BooleanSystemValue\" value=\"2\"/>\n\t\t\t</characteristic>\n\t\t\t<parm name=\"ConditionMetAction\" value=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t<parm name=\"ConditionNotMetAction\" value=\"2\"/>\n\t\t\t<parm name=\"ConditionRepeatCount\" value=\"120\"/>\n\t\t\t<parm name=\"ConditionNotMetAction\" value=\"1\"/>\n\t\t\t<parm name=\"ConditionFailMessage\" value=\"Ethernet connectivity not established before timeout\"/>\n\t\t\t<parm name=\"ConditionWaitMessage\" value=\"Please insert device into an Ethernet cradle within 2 minutes\"/>\n\t\t</characteristic>\n\t\t<characteristic version=\"0.6\" type=\"FileMgr\">\n\t\t</characteristic>\n\t</wap-provisioningdoc>\n\t\nIf the above Request XML document was used without the XmlMgr Feature at the beginning, then the FileMgr Feature would be executed regardless of whether a connection was successfully established via Ethernet. While that would likely result in an error, it might take much longer, since the FileMgr Feature would need to wait for a timeout. Further, the user experience would be inferior since the user would not be informed to insert device into the cradle and the failure would shed no light on why FileMgr \"could not connect to server\".\n\n###Using ConditionMetAction and ConditionNotMetAction\n\nThe two parms ConditionMetAction and ConditionNotMetAction provide identical options for choosing the action to take. While this means you could select the same action for both, that would likely never be the right thing to do. To review, the options are:\n\n* Success\n* Fail with characteristic-error\n* Retry (up to specified times) then Fail\n\nYou should select the first open \"Success\" for only one of these two parms, depending on whether \"true\" or \"false\" best represents the Condition where you want to continue executing Features.  For the other parm, you should select either \"Fail with characteristic-error\" or \"Retry (up to specified times) then Fail\", depending on whether you want to stop immediately or retry for a while before deciding to stop executing Features.\n\nWhen selecting \"Retry (up to specified times) then Fail\" for either of the parms ConditionMetAction or ConditionNotMetAction, you will need to specify the additional parms ConditionRepeatCount and ConditionRepeatInterval. Taken together, the values of these two parms control how long the total wait time may be. When using this capability, success can occur at any time, but failure requires \"exhausting the retries\".  The parm ConditionRepeatCount specifies how many time to try and the parm ConditionRepeatInterval specifies how long (in seconds) to wait between tries.  By multiplying these two, you can compute the minimum amount of time that must elapse before failure can occur. The actual time may be somewhat longer since some time may be taken to perform each Test. But in most cases, the wait time before failure should be close to the computed time.\n\n## Feature Compatibility\n\n<iframe src=\"compare.html#mx=4.3&csp=ConditionMgr&os=JB&embed=true\"></iframe> "},{"key":"guide-csp-cspmgr","name":" CspMgr","md":"# CspMgr\n\n## About CspMgr\n\n### Overview\n\nThe CspMgr Feature Type is used by the Mx Management Framework to maintain records of the Feature Types, which are required to submit their registration information to the CspMgr when the device boots up after an Enterprise or Factory Reset.\n\nFor MDMs, the main functionality of the CspMgr Feature Type that would be of use would be its queries.

src=\"compare.html#mx=4.3&csp=CspMgr&os=JB&embed=true\"></iframe> "},{"key":"guide-csp-devadmin","name":" DevAdmin","md":"# DevAdmin\n\n## About DevAdmin\n\n### Overview\n\nAndroid defines some APIs called the Device Administration APIs, as implemented within the DevicePolicyManager class. These APIs enable certain applications to perform various tasks that can affect the security of the device.  Since the use of these APIs can impact device security, they are restricted to use by specially approved applications, called Device Administrators. If an application is written to conform to the DeviceAdminReceiver model and is approved to become a Device Administrator, then it can use some or all of the Device Administration APIs.\n\nIn standard Android devices, an application that is written to conform to the DeviceAdminReceiver model must explicitly request the device user to approve it as a Device Administrator. This is based on the assumption that the device user is knowledgeable and is in the best position to make a determination. For a device that is owned or used by a single device user, that assumption may be reasonable. For an Enterprise-owned device that may be shared amongst multiple device users, that assumption may be a poor one.\n\nThe DevAdmin Feature Type allows you to perform certain device administration tasks directly. It also allows you to programmatically approve an application that is written to conform to the DeviceAdminReceiver model as a Device Administrator, without involving or notifying the device user. This allows an Enterprise to grant access to the Device Administration APIs to trusted applications, and thus enable those applications to perform device administration tasks.\n\n### Main Functionality\n\n* Set Screen-Lock Timeout Interval\n* Turn Installation of applications from Unknown sources On or Off\n* Turn Device Administrator approval On or Off for an application\n\n##Parameter Notes\n###Screen-Lock Timeout Interval\nPivotal parm: No\n\nParm name: ScreenLockTimeoutInterval\n\nDescription: \n\n>Android devices support two levels of inactivity timeout that can be controlled independently. The Display Screen Timeout, which can be controlled via the DisplayMgr Feature Type, controls the amount of device user inactivity that must elapse before the device display screen is automatically turned off. The Screen Lock Timeout, which can be controlled by the DevAdmin Feature Type, controls how long the device screen must remain off before a screen lock will occur.\n\n>When the device screen is turned back on, manually by some sort of device user activity, or programmatically due to some device event, the result will depend on how long the device screen was off and the value set for the Screen Lock Timeout. If the display screen was off for less than the Screen Lock Timeout, then the screen will not be locked (and hence will not need to be unlocked by the device user). If the display screen was off for at least the Screen Lock Timeout, then the screen will be locked (and hence will need to be unlocked by the device user).\n\n>This behavior can be modified in two ways, based on other aspects of the device that may be configured. First, if no lock behavior is set for the device (e.g. no pin or password), then \"unlocking\", if required, may only require a swipe, not any actual data entry by the device user. Second, if the device is configured to lock automatically when the display screen is turned off by the power key, then a screen lock will always occur when the display screen is turned back on after being turned off via the power key, regardless of how much time the display screen was off.\n\n>This parm will allow you to set the Screen Lock Timeout.\n\n>**Note:** The underlying Android display system only supports the selection of a fixed set of values for the Screen Lock Timeout. This parm can only set the actual Screen Lock Timeout to one of those supported values (listed in the table below). Specifying a value that is less than the smallest value shown in the table or greater than the largest value shown in the table will cause no change to be made to the current Screen Lock Timeout and will cause an error to be returned in the Result XML document. Specifying a value between two supported values shown in the table will cause the closest value to the requested value to be selected, with no error returned in the Result XML document.\n\n<div class=\"parm-table\">\n <table class=\"table\">\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<th>Parm Option Name</th>\n\t\t<th>Parm Value</th>\n\t\t<th>Description</th>\n\t</tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Do not change</td>\n    <td>\"0\"</td>\n\t<td>This value (or the absence of this parm from the XML) will cause no change to the Screen Lock Timeout.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Immediately after Display Timeout</td>\n    <td>\"1\"</td>\n\t<td>This value will cause the screen to be locked when the display screen is turned back on, regardless of how long the display screen was off.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>5 seconds after Display Timeout</td>\n    <td>\"5\"</td>\n\t<td>This value will cause the screen to be locked when the display screen is turned back on, if the display screen was off for at least 5 seconds.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>15 seconds after Display Timeout</td>\n    <td>\"15\"</td>\n\t<td>This value will cause the screen to be locked when the display screen is turned back on, if the display screen was off for at least 15 seconds.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>30 seconds after Display Timeout</td>\n    <td>\"30\"</td>\n\t<td>This value will cause the screen to be locked when the display screen is turned back on, if the display screen was off for at least 30 seconds.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>1 minute after Display Timeout</td>\n    <td>\"60\"</td>\n\t<td>This value will cause the screen to be locked when the display screen is turned back on, if the display screen was off for at least 1 minute.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>2 minutes after Display Timeout</td>\n    <td>\"120\"</td>\n\t<td>This value will cause the screen to be locked when the display screen is turned back on, if the display screen was off for at least 2 minutes.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>5 minutes after Display Timeout</td>\n    <td>\"300\"</td>\n\t<td>This value will cause the screen to be locked when the display screen is turned back on, if the display screen was off for at least 5 minutes.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>10 minutes after Display Timeout</td>\n    <td>\"600\"</td>\n\t<td>This value will cause the screen to be locked when the display screen is turned back on, if the display screen was off for at least 10 minutes.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>30 minutes after Display Timeout</td>\n    <td>\"1800\"</td>\n\t<td>This value will cause the screen to be locked when the display screen is turned back on, if the display screen was off for at least 30 minutes.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</div>\t\n\n###Install App from Unknown Sources\nPivotal parm: No\n\nParm name: UnknownSourcesStatus\n\nDescription: \n\n>Android devices have a feature called the Unknown Sources Option that controls whether the device user is allowed to install applications (APK files) that originate from \"unknown\" sources, by which is meant \"anywhere other than the Google Play Store\". The primary purpose for this feature is to block \"side loading\" of APKs that may be risky since they did not go through the vetting process associated with posting applications on the Google Play Store.\n\n>For devices that have GMS (Google Mobile Services), the Android CDD (Compatibility Definition Document) requires that the Unknown Sources Option be turned off by default. That makes sense for such devices, since they have support for Google Play (which is part of GMS) and hence have a viable way for device users to load applications. Zebra Android devices that have GMS will all default the Unknown Sources Option off by default to comply with this requirement. The Unknown Sources Option can then be turned on to allow device users the option of side-loading applications as an alternative to using Google Play.\n\n>For devices that do not have GMS, turning off the Unknown Sources Option would prevent device users from loading applications at all, since they do not have support for Google Play. Zebra devices that do not have GMS will typically default the Unknown Sources Option on by default so device users will have at least some method to install applications. The Unknown Sources Option can then be turned off to disallow device users from loading applications at all.\n\n>**Note:** The Unknown Sources Option only affects whether device users are allowed to install applications. It does not have any effect on whether applications can be programmatically installed, such as using the AppMgr Feature Type. The presumption is that any application that can be trusted to install other applications without involving or notifying the device user can be trusted to install only suitable applications and therefore whether those applications come from the Google Play Store or not is immaterial.\n\n>This parm allows you to turn the Unknown Sources Option on or off, both on devices that have GMS and those that do not have GMS.\n\n<div class=\"parm-table\">\n <table class=\"table\">\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<th>Parm Option Name</th>\n\t\t<th>Parm Value</th>\n\t\t<th>Description</th>\n\t</tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Do not change</td>\n    <td>\"0\"</td>\n\t<td>This value (or the absence of this parm from the XML) will not make any change to the Unknown Sources Option.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Turn On</td>\n    <td>\"1\"</td>\n\t<td>This value will turn the Unknown Sources Option on, which will allow the device user to install applications onto the device other than via Google Play.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Turn Off</td>\n    <td>\"2\"</td>\n\t<td>This value will turn the Unknown Sources Option off, which will prevent the device user from installing applications onto the device other than via Google Play.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</div>\t\n\n###Device Administration Action\nPivotal parm: Yes\n\nDescription: \n\n>This parm allows you to approve or remove approval to be a Device Administrator from an application that is written to conform to the DeviceAdminReceiver model.\n\n>By default, an application is not initially approved as a Device Administrator when it is first installed and launched. Only an application that is written to conform to the DeviceAdminReceiver model and that is currently installed can be approved to be a Device Administrator.\n\n>When an application that is written to conform to the DeviceAdminReceiver model is approved to be a Device Administrator, it will be notified so it can begin using the Device Administration APIs.

A DHCP Request sent by a device can contain information about the device or the DHCP Client or can contain additional requests for additional from the DHCP Server. A DHCP Acknowledgment sent by the DHCP Server contains the IP Address assigned to the device by the DHCP Server, along with any additional information requested by the device in the DHCP Request.\n\nDHCP Options are variable length strings that are identified by DHCP Options Numbers that can be included in a DHCP Request or a DHCP Acknowledgment to convey information between a DHCP Client and a DHCP Server. From the point of view of the device where the DHCP Client is running, a DHCP Option can support a mode of Write (if the DHCP Client sends the option to the DHCP Server in the DHCP Request) or Read (if the DHCP Client receives information from the DHCP Server in the DHCP Acknowledgment). DHCP can support a wide variety of DHCP Options, including custom options that can be defined by equipment vendors or end customers.\n\nThe DhcpOptionMgr Feature Type allows you to configure those DHCP Options that are configurable on Zebra Android devices.\n\n### Main Functionality\n\n* Enable or Disable the use of DHCP Options listed as configurable in the following table:\n\n<div class=\"dhcp-table\">\n <table class=\"table\">\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<th>DHCP Option Number</th>\n\t\t<th>DHCP Option Name</th>\n\t\t<th>Default State</th>\n\t\t<th>Configurable?</th>\n\t\t<th>Supported Mode(s)</th>\n\t</tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>1</td>\n    <td>Subnet Mask</td>\n\t<td>On</td>\n    <td>No</td>\n\t<td>Read</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>3</td>\n    <td>Routers</td>\n\t<td>On</td>\n    <td>No</td>\n\t<td>Read</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>6</td>\n    <td>Domain Name Servers</td>\n\t<td>On</td>\n    <td>No</td>\n\t<td>Read</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>12</td>\n    <td>Host Name</td>\n\t<td>On</td>\n    <td>Yes</td>\n\t<td>Write</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>15</td>\n    <td>Domain Name</td>\n\t<td>On</td>\n    <td>No</td>\n\t<td>Read</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>28</td>\n    <td>Broadcast Address</td>\n\t<td>Off</td>\n    <td>Yes</td>\n\t<td>Read</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>42</td>\n    <td>NTP Server</td>\n\t<td>Off</td>\n    <td>Yes</td>\n\t<td>Read</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>51</td>\n    <td>Lease Time</td>\n\t<td>On</td>\n    <td>No</td>\n\t<td>Read</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>66</td>\n    <td>TFTP Server Name</td>\n\t<td>Off</td>\n    <td>Yes</td>\n\t<td>Read</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>67</td>\n    <td>Boot File Name</td>\n\t<td>Off</td>\n    <td>Yes</td>\n\t<td>Read</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>77</td>\n    <td>User Class</td>\n\t<td>On</td>\n    <td>Yes</td>\n\t<td>Write</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>119</td>\n    <td>Domain Search List</td>\n\t<td>Off</td>\n    <td>Yes</td>\n\t<td>Read</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>150</td>\n    <td>TFTP Server Address</td>\n\t<td>Off</td>\n    <td>Yes</td>\n\t<td>Read</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</div>\t\n\n>**Note:**  DHCP Options that are shown as not configurable in the above table are supported on Zebra Android devices, but are always enabled and their operation cannot be altered in any way using the DhcpOptionMgr Feature Type.\n\n\n##Parameter Notes\n###Host Name\nPivotal parm: Yes\n\nDescription: \n\n>This parm allows you to control whether a Host Name will be sent by the DHCP Client to the DHCP Server via the Host Name DHCP Option.

When requested, the DHCP Server will return the TFTP Server Name to the device in the DHCP Acknowledgment.\n\n>**Note:** The DHCP Client does not automatically use the TFTP Server Name to perform any file transfers or configuration. To configure a device using TFTP, the TFTP Server Name would need to be acquired using the DhcpOptionMgr Feature Type and then provided to a TFTP Client that could perform the transfer of one or more files and then perform any desired configuration using those files.\n\n<div class=\"parm-table\">\n <table class=\"table\">\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<th>Parm Option Name</th>\n\t\t<th>Parm Value</th>\n\t\t<th>Description</th>\n\t</tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Do not change</td>\n    <td>\"0\"</td>\n\t<td>This value (or the absence of this parm from the XML) will cause no changes to how this DHCP Option is configured.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Enable</td>\n    <td>\"1\"</td>\n\t<td>This value will cause this DHCP Option to be turned on and hence will cause the TFTP Server Name to be requested by the DHCP Client in the DHCP Request.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Disable</td>\n    <td>\"2\"</td>\n\t<td>This value will cause this DHCP Option to be turned off and hence will prevent the TFTP Server Name from being requested by the DHCP Client in the DHCP Request.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</div>\n\n###Boot File Name\nPivotal parm: No\n\nParm name: BootFileState\n\nDescription: \n\n>A Boot File is a file that is typically used to configure a device when it first joins a network. A common usage scenario is to pull a Boot File of a given name from a TFTP Server and then use that Boot File to configure the device.\n\n>This parm allows you to control whether a request for a Boot File name will be sent by the DHCP Client to the DHCP Server in the DHCP Request. When requested, the DHCP Server will return the Boot File name to the device in the DHCP Acknowledgment.\n\n>**Note:** The DHCP Client does not automatically use the Boot File name to perform any file transfers or configuration.

When requested, the DHCP Server will return the Domain Search list for the network to the device in the DHCP Acknowledgment.\n\n>**Note:** The DHCP Client does not automatically use the Domain Search List to configure the DNS Client to resolve names based on the list. This may be a future enhancement, when the DNS Client provides a way to configure it to use such a list. In the meantime, if name resolution needs to be performed based on this list, it would have to be implemented at an application level.

At present, the only option is to configure the timeout value after which the display turns off to conserve battery power. Future versions of the DisplayMgr Feature Type may provide the ability to control other aspects of the display screen.\n\n### Main Functionality\n\n* Set the Display Screen Timeout Interval\n \n##Parameter Notes\n###Set the Screen Off Timeout Interval\nPivotal parm: No\n\nParm name: TimeoutInterval\n\nDescription: \n\n>This parm will allow you to set the timeout interval for the device's screen. When there are no device user interactions (e.g. touch panel or key activations) within the specified time interval, then the display screen of the device will automatically turn off. Setting this interval to a lower amount of time will help to conserve power on the device, at the expense of potentially reduced convenience for the device user.\n\n>**Note:** The underlying Android display system only supports the selection of a fixed set of values for the display screen timeout, determined by the values supported by the System Settings Menu.

This mode is particularly useful, from a security point of view, because it protects all data stored on the Storage Card from being accessed externally if the card is physically removed from the device.  In this mode, the entire card is encrypted, and the key used to perform the encryption is not stored on the card.  Since data is encrypted and decrypted transparently, applications running on the device can access all the data on the Storage Card as if it were not encrypted.  Applications access an encrypted Storage Card using the same paths they would use if the Storage Card was not encrypted. \n\n>**Note:** Changing a Storage Card from unencrypted to encrypted or encrypted to unencrypted requires reformatting the card and hence causes the loss of all data on the card.  If there is data that must be preserved, it would have to be copied to another location before activating or deactivating encryption and then copied back after the card is reformatted.\n\n* Folder Encryption Mode allows any number of Encrypted File Systems (EFS) to be created.  The data for each EFS resides in a single file that must be stored on some non-encrypted file system.  This file is called the Backing Storage File (BSF).  A BSF can be located on internal storage (e.g. /data) or on the Primary Storage Card.  The BSF is named based on the name of the EFS.  An EFS is mounted at a virtual path, called its Mount Point.  The Mount Point for an EFS could specify a path on the same non-encrypted file system where the BSF is located or could specify a path on a different file system.  Since data is encrypted and decrypted transparently, applications running on the device can access all the data on an EFS as if it was not encrypted.  Applications must access an EFS using the Mount Point path that is established when the EFS is created.\n\n>**Note:** While the BSF for an EFS can be stored on a Storage Card that is removable, it cannot be stored on a Storage Card that is encrypted using Full Storage Card Encryption Mode.  If an attempt is made to create an EFS, whose BSF is on a Storage Card that is encrypted using Full Storage Card Encryption, then an error will be returned in the Result XML.\n\nZebra Android devices have a Key Storage Database of named encryption keys.  Each Named Key has an associated Key Value that can be used to encrypt a Full Storage Card and/or to encrypt any number of EFSes.  When activating Full Storage Card Encryption or creating an EFS, a Named Key must be specified and must exist in the Key Storage Database.  If a Named Key is removed from the Key Storage Database, Full Storage Card Encryption and/or EFSes that are encrypted using that Named Key will become inaccessible.  Adding the Named Key (with the same Key Value) will restore accessibility.\n\nThe EncryptMgr Feature Type allows you to manage the Key Storage Database, activate or deactivate Full Storage Card Encryption, and create or delete EFSes.\n\n### Main Functionality\n\n* Add and Remove Named Keys\n* Create and Delete Encrypted File Systems\n* Format the Storage Card as Encrypted or Unencrypted\n\n##Parameter Notes\n###Install Key?\nPivotal parm: Yes\n\nDescription: \n\n>This parm allows you to choose whether or not to Add a Named Key to the Key Storage Database on the device.\n\n>**Note:** Only one Encrypted File System can be mounted at a time using a given Mount Point. If an attempt to create an EFS with a Mount Point that is already in used by a mounted EFS, the new EFS will be created, but will not be mounted.\n\n>Adding a Named Key to the Key Storage Database on the device makes a key available for use when activating Full Storage Card Encryption or when creating EFSes.\n\n>**Note:** If you Add a Named Key to the Key Storage Database, it can have an impact on a Storage Card or on Encrypted File Systems that were encrypted using that key and that previously became inaccessible when that key was Removed. By adding the same Key Name with the same associated Key Value, they will be re-mounted and hence will become accessible again.\n\n<div class=\"parm-table\">\n <table class=\"table\">\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<th>Parm Option Name</th>\n\t\t<th>Parm Value</th>\n\t\t<th>Description</th>\n\t</tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Do nothing</td>\n    <td>\"0\"</td>\n\t<td>This value (or the absence of this parm from the XML) will not cause a Named Key to be added to the Key Storage Database.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Install key</td>\n    <td>\"1\"</td>\n\t<td>This value will cause a Named Key, along with an associated Key Value, to be added to the Key Storage Database.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</div>\n\n####Install Key Name\nSettable if: The Install Key action is \"Install key\"\n\nPivotal parm: No\n\nParm name: InstallKeyName\n\nDescription: \n\n>This parm allows you to specify the name of the Named Key that will be added to the Key Storage Database.\n\n>**Note:** If an attempt is made to add a Named Key that is already in the Key Storage Database, then an error will be returned in the Result XML.\n\nParm value input rules: \n\n* String with a minimum size of 1 character\n\n####Install Key Value\nSettable if: The Install Key action is \"Install key\"\n\nPivotal parm: No\n\nParm name: InstallKeyValue\n\nDescription: \n\n>This parm allows you to specify the Key Value to be associated with a Named Key that is being added to the Key Storage Database.

Further, there is no method provided to guarantee that the same key is generated at a later time. This means that if a generated key is used for encryption and is then lost (such as due to Enterprise Reset), any data encrypted using that key will be unrecoverable.\n\nParm value input rules: \n\n* HEX string that is empty (length of zero) or must be exactly 64 bytes that encode a 128 bit binary value that will be used as an AES encryption Key Value.\n\n>**Note:** The generation of Key Values can be accomplished using any desired mechanism since any 128 bit value can be used as an AES encryption Key Value.  For best results, Key Values should be generated randomly, to make them hard to predict.

For the purposes of this discussion, the key characteristic of GPRS networks is the presence of a SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) Card to securely store the mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) number and its related key, which are used to identify and authenticate subscribers. Inserting a SIM Card allows basic cellular service (including voice and text messaging over a GSM network) to be established. However, cellular data service may require additional configuration that cannot be performed based solely on the information provided by the SIM Card.\n* CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) is a modulation method used in many mobile phone standards such as cdmaOne, CDMA2000 (the 3G evolution of cdmaOne), and WCDMA. For the purposes of this discussion, the key characteristic of CDMA networks is the lack of a SIM Card. Lacking a SIM Card often meant that cellular service has to be activated through a manual process between the device user and the cellular provider. During this activation process, all services (voice, text messaging, and cellular data) were generally configured.\n* LTE (Long-Term Evolution or 4G) is a modulation method that is a lends itself to the extension of both CDMA and GPRS into 4G. For the purposes of this discussion, the key characteristic of LTE networks is the presence of a SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) Card to securely store the mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) number and its related key, which are used to identify and authenticate subscribers. In addition, LTE SIM Cards contain additional information that generally allow cellular data service to be activated with the additional configuration that was often required for GPRS.\n\nAs noted above, devices that are operating on GSM networks, and that need to use GPRS cellular data over those networks, may need to perform additional configuration by providing information that cannot be obtained from the SIM Card. This required configuration is usually referred to as the APN (Access Point Name), although this is a bit of a misnomer since the configuration actually requires more than just the name of the Access Point. An APN identifies the packet data network (PDN) that a mobile data user wants to communicate with and may also define the type of service available. Configuring use of an APN by a device generally requires configuring the actual name of the Access Point as well as username and password information required to connect via that Access Point.\n\nA GPRS-equipped Android device must generally have a suitable APN defined for each GPRS cellular data network that will be used. If only one GPRS cellular data network will be used, then only one APN will need to be defined. But if multiple GPRS cellular data network will need to be used (e.g. to support roaming amongst multiple geographical locations), then multiple APNs would need to be defined.\n\nThe GprsMgr Feature Type allows you to Add or Remove APNs from the set of defined APNs and set which APN is the default APN to which the device will automatically connect.\n\n### Main Functionality\n\n* Add/Update or Remove APN\n* Remove all APNs\n* Set Default APN\n\n\n##Parameter Notes\n### APN Action\nPivotal parm: Yes\n\nDescription: \n\n>This parm allows you to choose the APN action that should be performed.\n\n<div class=\"parm-table\">\n <table class=\"table\">\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<th>Parm Option Name</th>\n\t\t<th>Parm Value</th>\n\t\t<th>Description</th>\n\t</tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Add/replace named APN</td>\n    <td>\"1\"</td>\n\t<td>This value will cause an APN to be added or replaced.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Remove existing named APN</td>\n    <td>\"2\"</td>\n\t<td>This value will cause a specified APN to be removed.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Remove all existing APNs</td>\n    <td>\"3\"</td>\n\t<td>This value will cause all existing APNs to be removed.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</div>\t\n\n####GPRS Carrier \nSettable if: The APN Action is \"Add/replace named APN\"\n\nPivotal parm: Yes\n\nDescription: \n\n>This parm allows you to specify whether the APN to be defined should be a standard pre-defined APN of a well-known GPRS carrier or if the APN should be configured by specifying custom information.\n\n<div class=\"parm-table\">\n <table class=\"table\">\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<th>Parm Option Name</th>\n\t\t<th>Parm Value</th>\n\t\t<th>Description</th>\n\t</tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>ATT</td>\n    <td>\"1\"</td>\n\t<td><p>This value indicates that AT&T is the GPRS carrier and that the standard public APN used by AT&T should be used.</p><p><b>Note:</b> If you want to use anything other than the standard AT&T public APN, then you should choose Custom and supply the values for the desired APN that must be obtained from AT&T.</p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>T-Mobile</td>\n    <td>\"2\"</td>\n\t<td><p>This value indicates that T-Mobile is the GPRS carrier and that the standard public APN used by T-Mobile should be used.</p><p><b>Note:</b> If you want to use anything other than the standard T-Mobile public APN, then you should choose Custom and supply the values for the desired APN that must be obtained from T-Mobile.</p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Custom</td>\n    <td>\"0\"</td>\n\t<td>This value indicates that the APN is not one of the pre-defined carrier APNs and should be configured by providing custom values provided by the GPRS carrier.\n</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</div>\t\n\n####APN Name\nSettable if: The APN Action is \"Add/replace named APN\" or \"Remove existing named APN\"\n\nPivotal parm: No\n\nParm name: ApnName\n\nDescription: \n\n>This parm allows you to specify the name by which the APN will be known in the device.

A Key Table is a list of behaviors that a key will exhibit when pressed. The Base table is a list of behaviors a key will have when a modifier key, such as the shift or control keys, is not pressed. All devices support the Base key table, while other key tables may only be supported on devices that have the modifier key for that key table. For instance the Blue Table is only supported on devices that have a blue key. While remapping a key, you can set the behavior for that key in each table supported by the device.\n\nThe modifiable key tables are:\n\n* Base - no modifier key was pressed\n* Blue - blue key was pressed before a key was pressed\n* Orange - orange key was pressed before a key was pressed\n* Grey - grey key was pressed before a key was pressed\n* Shift - shift key was pressed before a key was pressed\n* Control - control key was pressed before a key was pressed\n\n### Main Functionality\n\n* Default all key mappings\n* Remap a key\n\n##Parameter Notes\n###Action\nPivotal parm: Yes\n\nDescription: \n\n>This parm allows you to select if a key should be remapped so that it will perform a specified behavior when the key is pressed.\n\n>By default, all keys are mapped to a specific behavior. For instance, when the the letter \"A\" is pressed, a lowercase \"a\" will be sent. Through remapping, the behavior of this key could be changed to perform a different behavior when it is pressed.\n\n> **Note:** When adding a custom key map, you may want to Default all key mappings before applying your new key map.

Of these two versions, the most likely to be useful is the version of the MXMF, since it is most likely to affect overall capabilities. While the MXMF does not handle the actual details of processing XML (that is left to the CSPs that implement the Feature Types), the MXMF is responsible for some general XML parsing and validation, routing XML to appropriate CSPs, and error handling. As such, over time, bug fixes in the MXMF might be made and knowing the MXMF version might be useful to determine how a given XML Request might be handled. The version of the MX CSP would likely only be relevant in the unlikely event that a bug was fixed related to actually returning the MXMF version.\n\n### Main Functionality\n\n* Query the MXMF version number\n* Query the MX CSP version number\n\n\n##Parameter Notes\n###Version\nParm name: Version\n\nDescription:\n\n>This value returned for this parm is the version number of the MX CSP, which implements the MX Feature Type.

If a factory reset is done after installing the EMDK Device Runtime, this folder will get deleted and the PersistMgr will no longer work. \n \nThis problem can be fixed by reinstalling the EMDK Device Runtime Package on the TC55.\n\n##Example XML\n### Add a Persistent Profile\n\nThis Request XML document is used to persist an XML which is used to configure the device's clock.

The set of locations that can be used for OS Updates is determined based on the following set of rules. Since different devices have different characteristics, the set of locations that meet these rules, and hence the set of locations that can be used for OS Updates will vary by device.\n\n>* In Zebra devices running any version of Android, a location that is not accessible cannot be used for OS Updates. For example, a Storage Card to which access has been blocked, using the SdCardMgr Feature Types, cannot be used for OS Updates. Similarly, a Storage Card that is implemented via physically removable media would not be accessible if there was no media physically present.\n>* In Zebra devices running any version of Android, a location that is encrypted cannot be used for OS Updates. For example, if a Full Storage Card Encryption is enabled for a Storage Card, then no locations on that Storage Card could be used for OS Updates. Similarly, if an Encrypted File System was mounted on a Storage Card, then no locations within that Encrypted File System could be used for OS Updates.\n>* In Zebra devices running any version of Android, a location that cannot be written to by the entity wishing to perform the OS Update cannot be used for OS Updates unless the entity can somehow acquire the permissions necessary to write the OS Update ZIP file to that location.\n>* In Zebra devices running the Jelly Bean version of Android, a Storage Card that is emulated cannot be used for OS Updates. This limitation has been removed from devices running the Kit Kat version of Android.\n\n> To perform an OS Update, an appropriate OS Update ZIP file should be transferred to the device and stored in a suitable location in the device file system. The location to which the OS Update ZIP file is stored must be one of the locations supported for OS Update on that device. Once the OS Update ZIP file is stored in a suitable location in the device file system, the PowerMgr Feature Type can be used to initiate the update.\n\n>**Note:** The path specified to the PowerMgr Feature Type would normally be the same as the path to which the file was written when it was transferred to the device, but it doesn't always need to be the same. There may be multiple paths that can be used to store the file, all of which may cause the file to be stored in the identical location. But not all such paths may work to initiate the OS Update when specified via the PowerMgr Feature Type. So, it is strongly recommended to store the files using one of the paths defined in the following table and then to specify the same path to the PowerMgr Feature Type.\n\n<div class=\"parm-table\">\n

"},{"key":"guide-csp-sdcard","name":" SdCardMgr","md":"# SdCardMgr\n\n## About SdCardMgr\n\n### Overview\n\nZebra Android devices may have one or more storage areas that are collectively referred to as External Storage and individually as Storage Cards. Some devices support a special Storage Card that is implemented via a physically removable media (e.g. a Micro SD Card), whereas others do not. Most Zebra Android devices also implement at least one Storage Card that is simulated using flash memory that is built-into (not removable from) the device.\n\nWhen a device supports physically removable media, it may be important to control whether the Storage Card implemented by that physically removable media is allowed to be used. For example, removable media could provide a path via which unwanted software could be loaded onto the device or via which sensitive data could be extracted from the device. Disallowing the use of physically removable media could significantly increase device security by ensuring that such media cannot be used as a path to perform such activities.\n\nAll Zebra Android devices support the path \"/sdcard\", which is logically mapped to one of the supported Storage Cards. Most Zebra Android devices also support one or more paths under \"/storage\", such as \"/storage/sdcard0\" and /storage/sdcard1\", to access all supported Storage Cards. The path \"/sdcard\" will generally be a logical link to one of the paths under \"/storage\" corresponding to one of the supported Storage Cards.\n\n**Note:** Various Zebra Android devices support different numbers and types of Storage Cards and the exact path via which an application can access a particular Storage Card will vary by device. Variation is greatest amongst devices that are running the Jelly Bean version of Android and between those devices and devices that are running the Kit Kat version of Android. Variations are considerably less amongst devices that are running the Kit Kat version of Android, although some variations still exist due to differences in core device capabilities (e.g. presence of lack of a physical card slot or total amount of available built-in flash memory).\n\nThe SdCardMgr Feature Type allows you to control whether one specific External Storage on the device can be used. The Storage Card affected by the SdCardMgr Feature Type varies by device. On devices that support physically removable media, such as the TC55, the SdCardMgr Feature Type will always control access to the Storage Card that is implemented by physically removable media, whether or not such media is physically present. On devices that do not support physically removable media, such as the MC40, the SdCardMgr Feature Type will control access to the Primary Storage Card.\n\n**Note:** Since the primary use case for the SdCardMgr Feature Type is to control the security risks associated with physically removable media, the SdCardMgr Feature Type offers significantly less value on devices that do not support physically removable media than it offers on devices that do support physically removable media. In fact, it may be hard to come up with a significant use case for using the SdCardMgr Feature Type on devices that do not support physically removable media, since it may not significantly enhance device security.  Nonetheless, it is provided for completeness.\n\nThere may be many ways in which a Storage Card can be accessed. A Storage Card might be access via built-in privileged System applications, via installed unprivileged applications, or from a PC using a MTP or ADB over USB. A Storage Card might also be encrypted or have one or more encrypted file systems stored on it (see the EncryptMgr Feature Type).  But, if access to a Storage Card is disabled using the SdCardMgr Feature Type, then all access to that Storage Card, even by built-in privileged System applications, will be blocked, with no exceptions, until access is re-enabled again using the SdCardMgr Feature Type.\n\n### Main Functionality\n\n* Enable or Disable the usage of the single Storage Card supported on a given device\n\n##Parameter Notes\n###Enable or Disable use of SdCard\nPivotal parm: No\n\nParm name: SdCardUsage\n\nDescription: \n\n>This parm will allow you to control the Storage Card that is selected to support this feature on a given device. On devices that support physically removable media, that Storage Card will always be the one implemented by physically removable media. When disabled, the affected Storage Card will be completely inaccessible, to the device user and to all applications running on the device.

If this setting is turned on, the user will be asked if they want to join the network, which could be useful for personal or dual use devices which might want to use a public Wi-Fi connection at some point. However, turning these notifications on is not recommended for devices that are supposed to be used only on a single corporate Wi-Fi network since it might be harmful to offer a user the opportunity to connect to a rogue, non-secure network.\n\n <div class=\"parm-table\">\n <table class=\"table\">\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<th>Parm Option Name</th>\n\t\t<th>Parm Values</th>\n\t\t<th>Description</th>\n\t</tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Do not change</td>\n    <td>\"\"</td>\n\t<td>This value (or the absence of this parm from the XML) will not make any change to the current network notification setting.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Use network notification</td>\n    <td>\"true\"</td>\n\t<td>This value will cause the user to be notified when an unknown, open network comes into range</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Do not use network notification</td>\n    <td>\"false\"</td>\n\t<td>This value will cause the user to not be notified when an unknown, open network comes into range</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</div>\n\n### Country Selection Auto/Manual\nPivotal parm: Yes\n\nDescription: \n>By leaving this option unchecked, the country may be determined by the router or access point setting.

It also will not transmit unless it can auto-detect the country, which can be beneficial because the device cannot transmit with a frequency that is inconsistent with the Wi-Fi infrastructure and is therefore less likely to violate country-specific regulations.\n\n>If a Wi-Fi infrastructure does not support, 802.11d, then the country that is used by this infrastructure will need to be selected so

The Identity is synonymous with \"user name\" in many cases. However, different Authentication Servers can be configured to require different types of Identity, such as email addresses, device unique ID, etc. \n\n>The Identity is used as a way of getting accepted by the Authentication Server so that you can receive the encryption key that is needed to operate on the network. Once you are authenticated, the Identity does not have any further meaning and is not used to identify the device on the network.\n\n>Specifying an empty (length of zero) value (or the absence of this parm from the XML) will cause the Identity will not be set.\n\n\n##### **Anonymous Identity** \nSettable if: The Network Action is \"Add a New Network\" *AND* the Security Mode is \"Enterprise\" *AND* the Authentication is not \"EAP-TLS\" or \"LEAP\"\n\nPivotal parm: No\n\nParm name: AnonymousIdentity\n\nDescription: \n>When using an EAP type that has a secure tunnel over which authentication credentials can be delivered, it may be necessary to specify an Identity outside the tunnel as well as an Identity inside the tunnel. To protect the actual Identity from disclosure when sending it outside the tunnel, an Anonymous Identity can be sent outside the tunnel and the actual Identity, along with the password or other verifying credentials, can be sent inside the tunnel.\n\n>If no Anonymous Identity is specified, then the actual Identity will be sent outside the tunnel, if required. This may not be a problem since the password or other verifying credentials is only sent inside the tunnel, in modes that use a tunnel for secure credential delivery. So, using the actual Identity outside the tunnel would only risk disclosure of part of the information needed to authenticate. A separate Anonymous Identity can only be used if the Authentication Server is set up to support such use.\n\n>Specifying an empty (length of zero) value (or the absence of this parm from the XML) will cause the Anonymous Identity will not be set.\n\nParm value input rules: \n\n* String with a minimum of 0 characters and a maximum of 64 characters\n\n##### **Protect Password**\nSettable if: The Network Action is \"Add a New Network\" *AND* the Security Mode is \"Enterprise\" *AND* the Authentication is not \"EAP-TLS\"\n\nPivotal parm: No\n\nParm name: ProtectPassword\n\nDescription: \n>A Password is an authentication credential that is used to prove the authenticity of an Identity and therefore, is only used when the Security Mode is \"Enterprise\". All Authentication types require a Password except EAP-TLS, which uses a client certificate instead of a Password.\n\n>In most cases, it is important to protect a Password since, combined with the matching Identity, it can be used to authenticate and gain access to a network. Since the Password must be embedded within the XML, it is often desirable to encrypt the Password so that i cannot be extracted and exploited if the XML is intercepted. The ProtectPassword parm is used to indicate whether the Password will be specified in clear, unencrypted text or in encrypted form.\n\n##### **Password** \nPivotal parm: Yes\n\nDescription: \n>The password to be used to connect to the network.

This will involve sending potentially sensitive authentication credentials to the Authentication Server. It is usually not recommended to do this unless the authenticity of the Authentication Server can be verified, for example, ensuring it is not a \"man in the middle\".\n\n>The device contacts and challenges the Authentication Server to assert and prove its Identity through the use of a server certificate. The device must be able to establish the validity of that certificate and must trust the chain of authority of the issuer of that certificate. This would all occur whether or not a Server Certificate Name is specified.\n\n>By default, a certificate asserted by an Authentication Server will be trusted if it can be verified to have been validly issued by any trusted certificate authority. If a Server Certificate Name is supplied, then the certificate asserted by an Authentication Server will be trusted only if it is verified to have been validly issued by that specific trusted certificate authority. This increases the security by preventing the use of certificates issued by authorities that are not trusted to issue certificates to authentication servers.\n\n>Specifying an empty (length of zero) value (or the absence of this parm from the XML) will cause the Optional Server Certificate to not be set.\n\nParm value input rules: \n\n* String with a minimum of 0 characters and a maximum of 64 characters\n\n##### **Client Certificate Name (mandatory)**\nSettable if: The Network Action is \"Add a New Network\" and the Security Mode is \"Enterprise\" and the Authentication is \"EAP-TLS\"\n\nPivotal parm: No\n\nParm name: MandatoryClientCertificate\n\nDescription: \n>The name of the certificate alias that should be used to join the network (Mandatory).

When Authenticating using EAP types other than EAP-TLS, which would not require a client certificate, a client is still allowed. If used, the client certificate will be used to authenticate the device to the authentication server as part of the establishment of the secure tunnel over which further authentication credentials will be delivered. This means that the client certificate do not need to be unique, even if the authentication credentials are. The use of a client certificate can introduce an additional level of protection by requiring a device to possess a valid client certificate as well as valid authentication credentials. The client certificate serves as a first pass filter.\n\n>Specifying an empty (length of zero) value (or the absence of this parm from the XML) will cause the Optional Server Certificate to not be set.\n\nParm value input rules: \n\n* String with a minimum of 0 characters and a maximum of 64 characters\n\n##### **EAP-TLS and Certificate Alias**\nDue to current limitations of the Certificate Manager Feature (in an EAP-TLS scenario), it is not possible to \"override\" the Alias that is assigned to a Client Certificate and Private Key when they are installed into the Android KeyStore\n\nThe only way to determine the actual Alias that is assigned to a Client Certificate and Private Key when they are installed into the Android KeyStore is to examine the Android KeyStore after installation to determine which Alias was used:\n\n1. The same Alias will ALWAYS be assigned to a given Client Certificate and Private Key, no matter when, or on which device, it is installed\n\n2. Whenever a different Client Certificate is used, a different Alias will generally be assigned to the Client Certificate and Private Key\n\n###### **Manually Determining the Certificate Alias**\nA device can be used to capture the alias being used for the certificate being installed. It is recommended that the key store be cleared before performing these steps (Settings->Security->Clear Credentials)\n\n1. Use Certificate Manager to install the certificate onto a device.\n2. Navigate to Settings->Wi-Fi->'+'' to add a network\n3. Scroll to security, tap and select 802.1x EAP\n4. Scroll to EAP method, tap and select TLS\n5. Scroll to client certificate, tap and note a drop down box with \"(unspecified)\" and the alias of the installed certificate.

When not selected, Static IP address is used.\n\n>Most modern networks use DHCP to automatically assign IP Addresses to devices when they join the network. If DHCP is used, then all requisite IP Address information will be obtained automatically and no additional information will need to be provided.\n\n>If DHCP cannot be used for a particular network, then all IP Address information that is needed to operate on that network will need to be specified. None of the following IP Address information parms can be left blank, but they may not all require meaningful values, depending on the network.\n\n##### **Static IP Address**\nSettable if: The Network Action is \"Add a New Network\" *AND* the \"Use DHCP\" box is not checked\n\nPivotal parm: No\n\nParm name: IpAddress\n\nDescription: \n>Provide the static IP address to be assigned to the device on this network. \n\n>When not using DHCP, a valid IP Address for the device to use on the network must be specified and that IP Address must not be assigned to any other device on the same network.\n\nParm value input rules: \n\n* Must be a valid IPV4 address, example: 191.168.0.1\n\n##### **Gateway 1 IP Address**\nSettable if: The Network Action is \"Add a New Network\" *AND* the \"Use DHCP\" box is not checked\n\nPivotal parm: No\n\nParm name: IpGateway1\n\nDescription: \n>Provide the IP address of the first gateway to the network.\n\n>When not using DHCP, a valid Gateway IP Address may or may not be required. If there is a Gateway that can route traffic out of the current network, then the IP Address of that Gateway should be specified if the device will need to send traffic outside that network. If the network is essentially self-contained, then it may not be important what value is specified for this parm.\n\nParm value input rules: \n\n* Must be a valid IPV4 address, example: 191.168.0.1\n\n##### **Subnet Mask**\nSettable if: The Network Action is \"Add a New Network\" *AND* the \"Use DHCP\" box is not checked\n\nPivotal parm: No\n\nParm name: IpMask\n\nDescription: \n>Provide the subnet mask to be used on the network.\n\n>When not using DHCP, a subnet mask must be specified that is consistent with the network and is consistent with the IP Address assigned to the device for use on that network.\n\nParm value input rules: \n\n* Must be a valid IPV4 subnet mask, example: 255.255.255.0\n\n##### **DNS Server 1 IP Address**\nSettable if: The Network Action is \"Add a New Network\" *AND* the \"Use DHCP\" box is not checked\n\nPivotal parm: No\n\nParm name: IpDns1\n\nDescription: \n>Provide the IP address of the first DNS server.\n\n>When not using DHCP, a valid DNS Server IP Address may or may not be required. If there is a DNS Server that can resolve network names to IP Addresses on the current network, then the IP Address of that server should be specified if the device will need to resolve names for that network. If name resolution is not required, then it may not be important what value is specified for this parm.\n\nParm value input rules: \n\n* Must be a valid IPV4 address, example: 191.168.0.1\n\n##### **DNS Server 2 IP Address**\nSettable if: The Network Action is \"Add a New Network\" *AND* the \"Use DHCP\" box is not checked\n\nPivotal parm: No\n\nParm name: IpDns2\n\nDescription: \n>Provide the IP address of the second DNS server. When not using DHCP, a valid DNS Server IP Address may or may not be required. If there is a secondary DNS Server that can resolve network names to IP Addresses on the current network, then the IP Address of that server may be specified as a backup. If no alternate DNS Server is available or required, then it may not be important what value is specified for this parm.\n\n>Specifying an empty (length of zero) value (or the absence of this parm from the XML) will cause the DNS Server 2 IP Address to not be set.\n\nParm value input rules: \n\n* Must be a valid IPV4 address, example: 191.168.0.1\n\n#### Use Proxy\nPivotal parm: Yes\n\nDescription: \n>When selected, a Proxy is used for network connections. A proxy is a an intermediary service that routes HTTP requests and responses between clients on a device and another network (typically the internet or an intranet). When there is a proxy between the Wi-Fi network and some outer network, then HTTP-based applications, such as a Web Browser, may need to negotiate with that proxy to access the services of that outer network.\n\n##### **Proxy Host Name**\nSettable if: The Network Action is \"Add a New Network\" *AND* \"Use Proxy\" box is checked\n\nPivotal parm: No\n\nParm name: ProxyHostName\n\nDescription: \n>Provide the Host Name or IP Address of the computer on which the proxy is running. Host Name can be used only if the network provides suitable name resolution. Otherwise, an IP Address would need to be provided.\n\n>Since different Wi-Fi networks may have different proxies connecting them to different outer networks, proxy information, if needed, must be configured for each network.\n\nParm value input rules: \n\n* String with a minimum of 1 characters and a maximum of 64 characters\n\n##### **Proxy Port**\nSettable if: The Network Action is \"Add a New Network\" *AND* \"Use Proxy\" box is checked\n\nPivotal parm: No\n\nParm name: ProxyPort\n\nDescription: \n>Provide the port number of the proxy server on the computer on which the proxy is running on which the proxy is listening.\n\n##### **Bypass Proxy**\nSettable if: The Network Action is \"Add a New Network\" *AND* \"Use Proxy\" box is checked\n\nPivotal parm: No\n\nParm name: BypassProxy\n\nDescription: \n>Once a proxy is configured for a given network, all HTTP traffic will generally be routed to the outer network via that proxy.  \n\n>In some cases, it may be desirable to avoid routing selected Host Names or IP Addresses through the proxy. For example, you might want to access a local Web Server. This can be accomplished by listing the Host Names or IP Addresses for which the Proxy should be bypassed. To specify multiple Host Names or IP Addresses, separate them with commas.\n\nParm value input rules: \n\n* String with a maximum of 256 characters\n\n##Example XML\n\n### Managing Certificates

Each Feature is represented by a top-level characteristic tag in the Request XML document, whose type matches the Feature Type. For example, a Feature of Feature Type \"XmlMgr\" in XML would begin with:\n\n<characteristic type=\"XmlMgr\" ΓÇª\n\nThe MXMS executes Features, by passing them to the corresponding CSPs, in the order they appear in the Request XML document, by passing the characteristic to the corresponding CSP. When a Feature is executed by a CSP, the CSP returns Result XML. A characteristic tag is returned by the CSP to indicate that the Feature succeeded. A characteristic-error tag is returned by the CSP  to indicate that the Feature failed. The MXMS aggregates the Result XML returned by the CSPs in the order the Features are executed, to create the final Result XML.\n\nFor the purposes of discussing MXMS Error-Handling, any Feature that can be executed at all is considered a success and any Feature that cannot be executed at all is considered a failure. Errors are handled by the MXMS based on the Error Handling Mode that is in effect. The MXMS has a Default Error Handling Mode that is always in effect at the beginning of each new Request XML document that is processed. The Error Handling Mode can be left as the default or can be changed one or more times within a single Request XML document.\n\nWhen the Default Error-Handling Mode, \"Execute all to end\", is in effect, the MXMS executes all Features, whether they succeed or fail, until the end of the XML is reached. The MXMS then returns the Result XML which will contain the same number of characteristic tags plus characteristic-errors tags as there were characteristic tags in the Request XML document. This Error-Handling Mode basically tries to execute everything and reports what happens at the end. This mode is the default because it is good for most general situations. But if one Feature depends on another, this mode can cause a \"domino effect\" where one failure causes a whole sequence of failures.\n\nThe MXMS supports an additional Error-Handling Mode, \"Execute until error, then stop\", where it stops executing Features on the first failure and returns Result XML that contains only the characteristic tags for the Features that succeeded plus the characteristic-error tag for the Feature that failed. This mode can be beneficial when Features are dependent on each other since it avoids the \"domino effect\" where one failure causes a whole sequence of failures and also allows execution to be terminating sooner, without attempting Features that are doomed to fail.\n\nThe XmlMgr Feature Type allows you to specify the Error Handling Mode the MXMS should use when processing a Request XML document. If no XmlMgr Features are present in a Request XML document, then the entire document is processed using the Default Error Handling Mode. If an XmlMgr Feature is present in a Request XML document, then the Error Handling Mode specified by that XmlMgr Feature will be used by the MXMS when executing subsequent Features up until the next XmlMgr Feature or the end of the Request XML document, whichever comes first.\n\n### Main Functionality\n \n* Specify the XML processing mode to use\n\t* Execute all Features and return all successes and failures\n\t* Execute Features until first error, then stop and return all successes and first failure\n\t* Execute Features until first error, then skip to next \"Catch\" or end\n\t* Stop skipping and resume execution of Features\n\n\n##Parameter Notes\n### XML Processing Mode\nPivotal parm: No\n\nParm name: ProcessingMode\n\nDescription: \n\n>This parm allows you to specify the Error Handling Mode the MXMS should use when processing a Request XML document.\n\n<div class=\"parm-table\">\n <table class=\"table\">\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<th>Parm Option Name</th>\n\t\t<th>Parm Value</th>\n\t\t<th>Description</th>\n\t</tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Execute all to end</td>\n    <td>\"1\"</td>\n\t<td><p>This value will set the Error Handling Mode such that the MXMS will attempt to execute all Features that appear in the Request XML document, in the order they appear without respect to success or failure of each Feature.</p><p>The Result XML will then return all successes and all failures, in the order the execution of the Features were attempted.</p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Execute until error, then stop</td>\n    <td>\"2\"</td>\n\t<td><p>This value will set the Error Handling Mode such that the MXMS will attempt to execute Features that appear in the Request XML document, in the order they appear so long as those Features succeed, but will stop on the first failure and ignore the remaining Features in the Request XML.</p><p>The Result XML will then return all successes and the first failure, in the order the execution of the Features were attempted.</p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Try until error, then Skip to Catch</td>\n    <td>\"3\"</td>\n\t<td><p>This value will set the Error Handling Mode such that the MXMS will attempt to execute Features that appear in the Request XML document, in the order they appear so long as those Features succeed, but will stop on the first failure and begin skipping Features.</p><p>Features will be skipped until an XmlMgr Feature is encountered where parm ProcessingMode has the value \"4\" (\"Catch error, Execute remainder\") or the end of the Request XML document is reached.

This framework allows developers and administrators an extensible, efficient, reliable and scalable means for configuring and administrating Zebra Android devices. MX exposes capabilities that underlying CSPs provide to give the user access to both privileged and unprivileged APIs. Each CSP exposes its capabilities using DSD files that are included with the MDM Toolkit. These DSD files are then imported into a DSDtoXML tool to generate XML that can be sent to the MX framework running on the device to change a device configuration or behavior.\n\n## <a name=\"definitions\"></a> Definitions of Terms\n\n### Board Support Package (BSP)\n\nA BSP is the method that the device teams use to deliver the operating system for any of their devices. \n\nEvery device ships with a specific BSP version pre-installed that is suitable for use on that device model, which is reported via the \"Build number\". The BSP version that ships in devices of a particular model may or may not be updated just because a new BSP becomes available for that device model. They can generally be updated by downloading a newer (or sometimes older) BSP from the Zebra support website and applying it to the device via the OS Update Process for that device.\n\n### Android Open Source Project (AOSP)\n\nAOSP is the method that Google uses to release and distribute the source code for the Android Operating System for royalty-free use by the open source community. OEMs are free to use, modify, and extend AOSP as needed, subject to certain standard licensing requirements. Each BSP for any of the Zebra Android devices includes an operating system that was derived, directly or indirectly, from AOSP. These BSPs generally also include modifications and/or enhancements beyond AOSP that provide additional value to our customers.\n\n### Mobility Extensions (MX)\n\nMX is the umbrella term used to refer collectively to the entire experience offered by the Zebra Android devices. This means that MX represents all the value that a BSP offers over and above that provided by AOSP, including:\n\n* Changes and extensions to the Core Operating System (OSX)\n* Value-Add Features (e.g. Multi-User, Whitelisting)\n* The MX Management Framework (MXMF)\n* Configuration Service Providers (CSPs)\n* Changes and extensions to standard applications (e.g. Settings UI, Browser, Email Client, etc.)\n\n### Operating System Extensions (OSX)\n\nOSX is the term used to refer to changes and extensions to the standard AOSP as included in a BSP. OSX is versioned and the version of OSX in a device is the primary way to determine which changes and extensions are present in the operating system of that device. As a general rule, the version of OSX that is in a device can ONLY be changed by loading a different BSP (that contains a different version of OSX) into that device, via the OS update process.\n\n### MX Management Framework (MXMF)\n\nMXMF is a device subsystem that provides an interface to applications that wish to set or query the configuration of device subsystems. It does not directly implement set and query functions but provides a framework to support and host CSPs that do. MXMF can be built-into a BSP or can be added to a BSP after a device is shipped (via a patch applied via the OS update process). Applications and the MXMF communicate through an interchange of XMLs that conform to the **XML.DTD**, as described in the document **MX MF XML DTD**.\n\n### Document Type Definition (DTD)\n\nA DTD is a non-XML, standards-based document that defines the syntax of a class of related XML documents. It is used to specify the elements that are allowed to appear within all XML documents that are used for a specific purpose. \n\nThe following DTDs are used by the MXMF:\n\n* **XML.DTD** (described in the document **MX MF XML DTD**)\n\t* This DTD defines the syntax of XML Documents that can be consumed by CSPs that registered with the MXMF and that can be used to set and query the configuration of the device systems associated with those CSPs\n* **DSD.DTD** (described in the document **MX MF DSD DTD**)\n\t* This DTD defines the syntax of DSD documents that are used to define the capabilities of CSPs\n\n### Configuration Service Provider (CSP)\n\nA CSP is a device code module that implements the ability to set and query the configuration of a subsystem on a device (e.g. Clock, Wi-Fi, etc.). The capabilities that are supported and exposed by a CSP are defined by a corresponding DSD. \n\nA CSP is a plug-in to the MXMF which can ship as part of the MXMF, can be included in a BSP along with the MXMF, or can be downloaded to a device as needed. Before it can be used on a device, a CSP must be registered with the MXMF on that device and all calls to a CSP must go through the MXMF. The MXMF and CSPs communicate through XMLs that conform to the **XML.DTD**, as described in the document **MX MF XML DTD**.\n\n### Document Semantics Definition (DSD)\n\nA DSD is an XML Document that conforms to the **DSD.DTD**, as described in the document **MX MF DSD DTD** and that corresponds to and describes the capabilities of a CSP. It is used by tools to enable programmatic generation of XML that can then be consumed by a CSP. Some examples of these tools are EMDK Profile Manager, Staging Tool, and MDM Console.\n\nA DSD is created and maintained by the author of a CSP and each CSP must have a corresponding DSD that must be supplied when the CSP registers with the MXMF. A CSP and its corresponding DSD should generally be produced, maintained, and distributed together.\n\n### MX Management System (MXMS)\n\nMXMS is a term used to refer to the MXMF and all CSPs that are registered with the MXMF at a given point in time. It provides the ability to set and/or query the configuration of the device subsystems for which CSPs are registered with MXMF. There are three kinds of CSPs that are included in this:\n\n* CSPs that are built-into the MXMF, such as the CertMgr CSP\n* CSPs that are built-into a device and pre-registered with MXMF, such as the Wi-Fi CSP\n* CSPs that are optional and can be downloaded to a device and then can be registered, unregistered, or updated, as needed. \n\nMXMS can be thought of as \"the MXMF and a collection of currently registered CSPs\". Although applications submit XML to the MXMF, it is a bit more accurate to say that the MXMS (not just the MXMF) is the entity via which applications set and/or query configuration.\n\n## <a name=\"arch\"></a>  MX Architecture and Data Flow\n\nSystem components:\n\n* MXMS\n\t* MXMF\n\t* CSPs\n\t\t* Unprivileged\n\t\t* Privileged\n\t* AOSP APIs\n\t\t* Unprivileged\n\t\t* Privileged\n\t* OSX APIs\n\t\t* Privileged\n\t* Core Applications\n\n### Overview\n![img](images/quick-start/architecture-overview.png)\n\n### Creating/Editing an XML Document\n\n![img](images/quick-start/architecture-createXml.png)\n\n### Android Device BSP\n\n![img](images/quick-start/architecture-bsp.png)\n\n## MDM Interface to MXMS\n\nSince Tier 2 and Tier 3 MDM Agents will not be signed, they must perform all privileged management functions by interfacing to MXMS. This interface is documented and enabled by the EMDK for MDMs and consists of:\n\n* Constructing a suitable Request XML document\n* Submitting the Request XML document to MXMS\n* Receiving a Result XML document back from MXMS\n* Parsing the Result XML document to determine what happened\n\n![img](images/quick-start/mdmInterface.png)\n\n<!--\n### Configuration by MDM Server/Agent\n\n![img](images/quick-start/architecture-configServerAgent.png)\n\n### Configuration by MDM Agent\n\n![img](images/quick-start/architecture-configAgent.png)\n\n-->\n### Recommended Implementation \n\n#### XML Created by MDM Agent\n\n<!--\n### MDM Agent Submits XML to MXMS\n\n![img](images/quick-start/architecture-submitXml.png)\n\n### MXMF routes XML to CSPs\n-->\n\nIn this model, the MDM Agent would submit Request XML documents to MXMS, which would then process the XML and route it to the appropriate CSPs. The CSPs would attempt to perform the requested actions and would return their own Result XML documents. These documents would be combined by the MXMF Results Handler and one complete Result XML document would then be returned to the MDM Agent. \n\n![img](images/quick-start/architecture-routesXmls.png)\n\nHere, the MDM Server has no inherent understanding of the Request and Result XML documents or DSDs used by MXMS, and the MDM Agent has inherent understanding of the Request and Result XML documents.\n\n1. An MDM Administrator creates a proprietary command within the MDM Server using a Proprietary UI presented by the MDM Server based on a Proprietary feature-set shared between the MDM Server and MDM Agent. \n2. The MDM Server delivers the proprietary command to the MDM Agent via the Proprietary Server/Agent communications protocol. \n3. The MDM Agent interprets proprietary command and creates a Request XML document to perform the desired function using one or more CSPs based on a hard-coded knowledge of the capabilities of the available CSPs and the XML required to perform specific management operations using those CSPs. \n4. The MDM Agent submits the created Request XML Document to the MXMS and receives back a Result XML document. \n5. The MDM Agent interprets the Result XML document based on a hard-coded knowledge of the XML results that can be returned by the CSPs it uses to perform management operations. \n6. The MDM Agent forms a proprietary response that communicates the interpreted results and delivers it to the MDM Server Agent via the Proprietary Server/Agent communications protocol.\n7. The MDM Server interprets the proprietary response and presents the results to the MDM Administrator using a Proprietary UI.\n\n![img](images/quick-start/implementation4.png)\n\n### Other Implementation Approaches\n\n#### XML Created by MDM Administrator\n\nIn this model, the MDM Server and MDM Agent have no inherent understanding of the Request and Result XML documents used by MXMS. \n\n1. An MDM Administrator obtains or creates a Request XML document offline (using a text editor or a tool provided by Zebra) and provides the XML document to the MDM Server via the MDM Server Proprietary UI.\n2. The MDM Server treats the Request XML document as an opaque payload and delivers it to the MDM Agent via the Proprietary Server/Agent communications protocol.\n3. The MDM Agent treats the Request XML document as an opaque payload and submits it to the MXMS and receives back a Result XML document. \n4. The MDM Agent treats the Result XML document as an opaque payload delivers it to the MDM Server Agent via the Proprietary Server/Agent communications protocol. \n5. The MDM Server treats the Result XML document as an opaque payload and provides it to the MDM Administrator via the MDM Server Proprietary UI. \n6. The MDM Server interprets the Result XML document offline (using a text editor or a tool provided by Zebra) to determine the results of the request.\n\n![img](images/quick-start/implementation1.png)\n\n#### XML Created by MDM Server\n\nIn this model, the MDM Server has an inherent understanding of the Request and Result XML documents (but not the DSDs) used by MXMS, and the MDM Agent has no inherent understanding of any of them. \n\n1. An MDM Administrator creates a Request XML document within the MDM Server using a Proprietary UI presented by the MDM Server based on a hard-coded knowledge of the capabilities of selected CSPs and the XML required to perform specific management operations using those CSPs. \n2. The MDM Server delivers the Request XML document to the MDM Agent via the Proprietary Server/Agent communications protocol. \n3. The MDM Agent treats the Request XML document as an opaque payload and submits it to the MXMS and receives back a Result XML document. \n4. The MDM Agent treats the Result XML document as an opaque payload delivers it to the MDM Server Agent via the Proprietary Server/Agent communications protocol. \n5. The MDM Server interprets the Result XML document and presents those results to the MDM Administrator using a Proprietary UI presented by the MDM Server based on a hard-coded knowledge of the XML results that can be returned by CSPs the MDM Server uses to perform management operations.\n\n![img](images/quick-start/implementation2.png)\n\n#### XML Created by MDM Server Using DSD\n\nIn this model, the MDM Server has an inherent understanding of the Request and Result XML documents and DSDs used by MXMS, but the MDM Agent does not. \n\n1. An MDM Administrator creates a Request XML document within the MDM Server using a Data-Driven UI presented by the MDM Server based on a selected DSD. \n2. The MDM Server delivers the Request XML document to the MDM Agent via the Proprietary Server/Agent communications protocol. \n3. The MDM Agent treats the Request XML document as an opaque payload and submits it to the MXMS and receives back a Result XML document. \n4. The MDM Agent treats the Result XML document as an opaque payload delivers it to the MDM Server Agent via the Proprietary Server/Agent communications protocol. \n5. The MDM Server interprets the Result XML document and presents those results to the MDM Administrator using a Data-Driven UI presented by the MDM Server based on the corresponding DSD.\n\n![img](images/quick-start/implementation3.png)\n\n\n## MX on Devices\n\nThe MX version on a specific device can be effected by:\n\n* OS Updates\n* EMDK for Android Device Runtime Updates\n\nWith each version of MX, new CSPs can be introduced, and pre-existing CSPs can also have new behavior. It is generally not found that MX updates will remove or change pre-existing behavior unless specifically noted.\n\n## CSP Summary\nBelow is a summary of the included CSPs. Make sure to consult the individual CSP reference found in this documentation, to see more details about the specific CSP features.\n\n### AccessMgr\nThe Access Manager feature allows you to configure a set of applications that will be allowed to run and install on the device. When this feature is enabled, the device will only allow user installed applications on the Whitelist to be executed and/or installed (some applications that are part of the default operating system will still be available). To disable the Whitelist, you would select 'Single User Without Whitelist'.  \n\n### AppMgr\nThe App Manager feature allows you to install, upgrade, remove, enable, disable applications from the device. It also allows you to change the current application launcher, clear recent app list and much more.\n\n### BrowserMgr\nThe Browser Manager feature allows your application to control the web browser on the device. For example you can set the browser homepage. \n\n### CameraMgr\nThe Camera Manager feature allows your application to control access to the cameras in the device. For example you can disable the user from using all cameras on the device. \n\n### CellularMgr\nThe Cellular Manager feature allows you to configure options of the  cellular radio on your device. \n\n### CertMgr\nThe Cert Manager feature allows your application to install or uninstall certificates and initialize the Android key store. You can use digital certificates to identify your device for a variety of purposes, including VPN or Wi-Fi network access as well as authentication to servers by apps such as Email or Chrome. \n\n### Clock\nClock allows for a programmatic way to set the date and time. To account for time zone nuances including daylight saving time, Clock expects the values for date and time to be entered as normalized values to UTC (GMT) time. In other words, the date and time set as parameters for Clock must be the UTC (GMT) equivalent of the local time being set. \n\n### DevAdmin\nThe Device Admin feature allows your application to manage configuration settings on the device.\n\n### DisplayMgr\nThe Display Manager feature allows your application to control the screen timeout value to conserve power.\n\n### EncryptMgr\nThe Encrypt Manager allows the developer to set encryption policies on a device. For example a developer can create an EFS for storing application data.  \n\n### FileMgr\nThe File Manager feature allows your application to manage files on the device. For example you can download a file from a ftp server and save it on the device.\n\n### GprsMgr\nThe GPRS feature allows you to add or remove APNs to your device. \n\n### Intent\nThe Intent Manager feature helps your application to create and send intents on the device.\n\n### PersistMgr\nThe Persist Manager is used to create and remove persistent profile features. These features and their parameters will survive and be automatically applied after a 'Enterprise Reset'. \n\n### PowerMgr\nThis feature allows you to put the device into Sleep mode, re-power or perform an OS Update. The action will be performed when the configuration is set.\n\n### PowerKeyMgr\nThe PowerKey Manager feature allows your application to control which options appear on the power menu on the device.\n\n### SdCardMgr\nThe SdCard Manager allows your application to manage the use of the device's SD card.\n\n### SettingsMgr\nSettings Manager feature allows you to manage settings UI configuration by providing the ability to invoke Enterprise Reset in Settings UI of your device.\n\n### ThreatMgr\nThe Threat Manager feature allows your application to control what security threats a device actively monitors for and how to respond.\n\n### TouchMgr\nThe Touch Manager feature allows you to set the Touch Mode on your device in order to interact with the user interface.\n\n### UiMgr\nThe UI Manager feature allows you to manage UI configurations using its UI Manager parameters. \n\n### UsbMgr\nThe USB Manager feature allows you to manage USB configurations of your device.\n\n### Wi-Fi\nThe Wi-Fi feature allows you to manage your device's Wi-Fi settings as well as manage the network profiles to be used for connecting and remembering networks.\n\n### WirelessMgr\nThe Wireless Manager allows you to configure wireless configurations on your device.

Using the DSDtoXml tool provided in the MDM Toolkit will provide a template for the XML to be used for applying settings. Typically you will use this tool to generate all needed functions and then replace string values for dynamically changing variables.\n* **Submitting XML** - Within the MDM client, XML will be submitted to apply settings via a simple API.\n<!--* **Checking Response** - the MDM client will need to handle response from the MX framework for interpreting submit or query results -->\n* **Querying MX** - Within the MDM client, XML will be submitted to query MX to receive back information about the current settings on the device.\n* Next Steps\n\n## Requirements\n\n* MDM Toolkit (XML Generator Tool, DSD Files)\n* Symbol Android Device with MX\n* Java JVM Installed\n* Android ADT\n\n## Intro To MX\n\n### MX Overview\n\nThe MX Framework provides a common interface to Zebra Android device capabilities utilizing XML that conforms to the standard OMA-CP PROV (Microsoft MSPROV) schema. This framework allows developers and administrators an extensible, efficient, reliable and scalable means for configuring and administrating Zebra Android devices. MX exposes capabilities that underlying CSPs provide to give the user access to both privileged and unprivileged APIs. Each CSP exposes its capabilities using DSD files that are included with the MDM Toolkit. These DSD files are then imported into a DSDtoXML tool to generate XML that can be sent to the MX framework running on the device to change a device configuration or behavior.\n\nFor more information on the definitions of necessary terms, the MX architecture and data flow, MDM implementation approaches, CSP summaries and other information, please see [this page.](#guide-MX-overview)\n\n### MXMS XML\n\nMXMS utilizes XML that conforms to the PROV DTD and more specifically to the Microsoft-defined dialect, which is defined by the MSPROV DTD. PROV DTD is the XML schema used by the OMA CP (Open Mobile Alliance Client Provisioning) Standard. Use of this XML schema means that XML that can be consumed by MXMS will be familiar to MDM Vendors that are already familiar with OMA CP and/or the PROV DTD. Use of this XML schema also means that MXMS can be more easily leveraged by existing MDMs that are based on or can already leverage OMA CP.\n\nFor more information on the XML elements, Request and Result XML documents, DSDs and other information, please see [this page.](#guide-xml-xml_overview)\n\n### MDM XML Creation\n\nThe XML documents that are used in MX need to be structured in a standardized format. The DSDtoXML tool, which is included in this toolkit, can be used to generate sample XML. Typically you would require that some values be changed dynamically on the device by your client application. So you would therefore manipulate the values of specific parameter attributes within your code based on the specific template you have generated. \n\nFor more information and instructions on XML generation, modifying values, and other information, please see [this page.](#guide-xml-generate)\n\n### MDM Result XML Parsing\n\nWhen submitting a Request XML document, knowing what happened will require at least some minimal parsing of the Result XML document. Parm Value Extraction is a method for simplifying the extraction of relevant information from an XML Result document, which involves searching an XML document for a parm with a given name and extracting the value associated with it.\n\nFor more information on Result XML documents and Parm Value Extraction, please see [this page.](#guide-xml-response)\n\n## Binding to MX\n\n1. Create a new Android project with an empty activity in Eclipse.   \n\n2. The following permissions needs to be added to your application's manifest file to allow it to access MXMS.\n\n\t\t:::xml\n        <uses-permission android:name=\"com.symbol.mxmf.ACCESS_MX_MANAGEMENT_FRAMEWORK_SERVICE\" />\n\t\t<uses-permission android:name=\"com.motorolasolutions.emdk.mxframework.ACCESS_MX_MANAGEMENT_FRAMEWORK_SERVICE\"/>\n\t\t\n3. Create two new packages in your application. One package should be named \"com.symbol.mxmf\" and the other package should be named \"com.motorolasolutions.emdk.mxframework\". These packages will be used for holding the aidl (Android Interface Definition Language) files.\n\n4. The SimpleMdmToolKitSample project, which is supplied in the MDM Toolkit, contains the IMxFrameworkService.aidl files that should be copied into your application. These AIDL files are located in the SimpleMdmToolKitSample's \"com.symbol.mxmf\" and \"com.motorolasolutions.emdk.mxframework\" packages. These AIDL files should be copied into the respective packages that were made in Step 2.\n\n5. In the package that contains the empty activity that was created in Step 1, copy and paste the following classes from the SimpleMdmToolKitSample project's \"com.symbol.simplemdmtoolkitsample\" package:\n\n\t* MxNamespace.java\n\t* MxNamespaceMotorolaSolutions.java\n\t* MxNamespaceSymbol.java\n\t* SymbolBrand.java\n\t* XmlParser.java\n\n\t>**Note:** The package names in these classes will need to be edited to match the package name of your application.\n\n6. In your application's activity, the onCreate method should call the init method that is in the SymbolBrand class. This will check that MXMS is installed on the device. If MXMS is detected, your application will be bound to MXMS, allowing interaction to occur between them.\n\n\t\t:::java\n\t\t// Variable to hold the main activity\n\t\tstatic private Activity m_activity;\n\t\n\t\t@Override\n\t\tprotected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tsuper.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n\t\t\tsetContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t// Save the main activity so it can be accessed from other threads\n\t\t\tm_activity = this;\n\n\t\t\t// Call init ONCE to start the process of binding to the MXMS\n\t\t\t// Note: You should call init early (e.g. as shown here in onCreate)\n\t\t\t//       XML cannot be submitted to the MXMS the binding is complete\n\t\t\tSymbolBrand.MXMS.init(this,mMxFrameworkServiceConnection);\n\t\t}\n\n7. The ServiceConnection will also need to be added to your application's activity. This will contain the onServiceConnected callback that will notify your application that it was successfully bound to MXMS. It should also contain the onServiceDisconnected callback that will notify your application when it was successfully unbound with MXMS.\n\n\t\t:::java\n\t\t// This definition is mandatory to track binding to the MXMS\n\t\tprivate ServiceConnection mMxFrameworkServiceConnection = new ServiceConnection()\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t// Callback to notify when binding to the MXMS has completed\n\t\t\tpublic void onServiceConnected(ComponentName className,IBinder service)\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t// Callback to notify when unbinding from the MXMS has occurred\n\t\t\tpublic void onServiceDisconnected(ComponentName className)\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}; \n\n8. In the onServiceConnected method, the onServiceConnected in the SymbolBrand helper class should also be called, which will notify this class that your application was bound to MXMS. At the end of the method, the term method in the SymbolBrand class should be called, which will unbind your application from MXMS. The application can also exit at this point. In the onServiceDisconnected method, the onServiceDisconnected method in the SymbolBrand helper class should also be called, which will notify this class that your application was unbound from MXMS.\n\n\t\t:::java\n\t\t// This definition is mandatory to track binding to the MXMS\n\t\tprivate ServiceConnection mMxFrameworkServiceConnection = new ServiceConnection()\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t// Callback to notify when binding to the MXMS has completed\n\t\t\tpublic void onServiceConnected(ComponentName className,IBinder service)\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t// Pass the binding notification on so the helper class can know the service was bound\n\t\t\t\tSymbolBrand.MXMS.onServiceConnected(className,service);\n\n\t\t\t\t// Call term \n\t\t\t\tSymbolBrand.MXMS.term(m_activity,mMxFrameworkServiceConnection);\n\n\t\t\t\t// Exit the application\n\t\t\t\tm_activity.finish();\t    \t\t\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t// Callback to notify when unbinding from the MXMS has occurred\n\t\t\tpublic void onServiceDisconnected(ComponentName className)\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t// Pass the unbinding notification on so the helper class can know the service was unbound\n\t\t\t\tSymbolBrand.MXMS.onServiceDisconnected(className);\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t};    \n\n\n\n<!--\n\n2. Create a new package in your application with the following name \"com.symbol.mxmf\". This will be used for holding the aidl (Android Interface Definition Language)file.  \n\n3. Create a file called \"IMxFrameworkService.aidl\" inside the new package.  \n\n4. Copy the following code into your aidl file, which defines to MX Interface:\n\n        :::java\n\t    package com.symbol.mxmf;\n     \n\t    // IMxFrameworkService.aidl\n\t    // Declare any non-default types here with import statements\n\t\n\t    /**\n\t     *  MX Management Framework AIDL service interface\n\t     */\n\t\tinterface IMxFrameworkService {\n\t      /**\n\t\t   * Provide Mx Framework Service(s) to process a clinet's request\n\t\t   * @param  sRequest - request String in XML format sent by a client\n\t\t   * @return a String from Mx Framework Service's response in XML format\n\t\t   */\n\t       String processXML(String sRequest);\n    \n\t       /**\n\t\t   * Provide Mx Framework Service(s) to process a clinet's request\n\t\t   * @param  sRequest - request String in XML format sent by a client\n\t\t   * @param  mapExtra - a map that contains Extra information on how the request XML should be applied\n\t\t   * @return a String from Mx Framework Service's response in XML format\n\t\t   */\n\t       String processXmlRequest(String sRequest, in Map mapExtra);\n\t\n\t       /**\n\t\t    * Get value from CSP by providing a key\n\t\t    * @param  sKey - a key that CSP would understand, then return a value to MxFramework.\n\t\t    * @return a value\n\t\t    */\n\t        String getValue(String sKey);\n\t\t}\n\n    \n\n5. Add the Permission to your manifest file to allow MX accesses.  \n\n        :::xml\n        <uses-permission android:name=\"com.symbol.mxmf.ACCESS_MX_MANAGEMENT_FRAMEWORK_SERVICE\" />\n\n    \n6. Implement \"ServiceConnection\" from your MainActivity, and add unimplemented methods. You should now have methods for \"onServiceConnected\" and \"onServiceDisconnected\".   \n\n7. Copy the following variables to the top of your MainActivity for holding values needed for MX.  \n\n        :::java\n\t\t//Application Context for MX \n\t\tContext context = null;\n\t\t\n\t    //MX Framework package name\n\t\tprivate static final String MX_FRAMEWORK_PKG =\"com.symbol.mxmf\";\n\t\n\t\t//MX Framework service class name\n\t\tprivate static final String MX_FRAMEWORK_SERVICE_CLS =\"com.symbol.mxmf.MxFrameworkService\";\n\t\n\t\t//MX service holder\n\t\tpublic IMxFrameworkService MXservice = null;\n\n    \n\n8. Add the following method to \"MainActivity\" for binding to the MX service. \n\n        :::java\n\t    void bindService(){\n\t\t    //Bind to Remote Service\n\t\t    Intent bindServiceIntent = new Intent();\n\t\t    //Set Component\n\t\t    bindServiceIntent.setComponent(new ComponentName(MX_FRAMEWORK_PKG, MX_FRAMEWORK_SERVICE_CLS));\n\t\t\n\t\t    try{\n\t\t\t    this.context.bindService(bindServiceIntent, this, Context.BIND_AUTO_CREATE);\n\t\t    }\n\t\t    catch(Exception e)\n\t\t    {\n\t\t\t    Log.e(\"MX\", e.toString());\t\t\n\t\t    }\n\t    }\n\n\t\n\n9. Add the following code to \"onCreate\" for getting the application context and calling the binding method. \n\n        :::java\n\t    //Get Application Context\n\t    this.context = this.getApplicationContext();\n\t\n\t    // Call bindService\n\t\tbindService();\n\n\t\n\n10. Add the following code to \"onServiceConnected\" to set the service reference. \n\n        :::java\n\t    //Set service\n\t\tthis.MXservice = IMxFrameworkService.Stub.asInterface(service);\n\n\t\n\n11. Add the following code to \"onServiceDisconnected\" to set the service reference to null. \n\n        :::java\n\t    //Set service to null\n\t\tthis.MXservice=null;\n\n\t\n\n>Note:  \n> you can use the following code to close the connection to MX. \n>\n>     :::java\n>     //Unbind service\n>     this.context.unbindService(this);\n>\n>     //Set service to null\n>     this.MXservice = null;\n\n-->\n\n## Generating XML\n\n###Creating a Set XML\n\n1.

Select a location to save your XML configuration file on your computer, give it a name, and select \"Save\".  \n![img](images/xmlgensavelocation.jpg)\n6. You can now open the file with a text or XML editor to view the generated XML. For example:\n\n    \t:::xml\n\t\t<wap-provisioningdoc>\n\t\t\t<characteristic type=\"Clock\" version=\"4.2\" >\n\t\t\t\t<parm name=\"AutoTime\" value=\"false\"/>\n\t\t\t\t<parm name=\"TimeZone\" value=\"GMT-5\"/>\n\t\t\t\t<parm name=\"Date\" value=\"2014-12-03\"/>\n\t\t\t\t<parm name=\"Time\" value=\"11:00:00\"/>\n\t\t\t</characteristic>\n\t\t</wap-provisioningdoc>\n\n>Note: Notice the relationship with the `parm` attributes and associated `value`. \n-->\n\n## Submitting XML\n\nIn your application's activity's onServiceConnected method, you can add code before the term call that would submit XML to MXMS. This example adds the utilizeMXMS method here, which will show how to edit XML and submit them to MXMS. However, it would be possible to repeatedly call this method from other locations. The onServiceConnected method is the first location where this method could possibly be called.\n\n\t\t:::java\n\t\t// This definition is mandatory to track binding to the MXMS\n\t\tprivate ServiceConnection mMxFrameworkServiceConnection = new ServiceConnection()\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t// Callback to notify when binding to the MXMS has completed\n\t\t\tpublic void onServiceConnected(ComponentName className,IBinder service)\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t// Pass the binding notification on so the helper class can know the service was bound\n\t\t\t\tSymbolBrand.MXMS.onServiceConnected(className,service);\n\n\t\t\t\t// For the purposes of this test application, we call this from here because this is the FIRST time it can be done\n\t\t\t\t// In a real world situation, it might be called repeatedly from other locations, as things that need to be done are identified\n\t\t\t\tutilizeMXMS();\n\n\t\t\t\t// Call term \n\t\t\t\tSymbolBrand.MXMS.term(m_activity,mMxFrameworkServiceConnection);\n\n\t\t\t\t// Exit the application\n\t\t\t\tm_activity.finish();\t    \t\t\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t// Callback to notify when unbinding from the MXMS has occurred\n\t\t\tpublic void onServiceDisconnected(ComponentName className)\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t// Pass the unbinding notification on so the helper class can know the service was unbound\n\t\t\t\tSymbolBrand.MXMS.onServiceDisconnected(className);\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}; \n\nIn this example, the utilizeMXMS method is used to demonstrate how to take an XML from the application's Assets folder, change the values of a parm, and send this Request XML document to MXMS. The Result XML document that is returned is then used to get the value of one of the parms. Through the use of the methods that are mentioned here, you can create an application that also performs these actions.\n\n1. The utilizeMXMS method uses the isReady method from the SymbolBrand class to check if the application successfully bound to MXMS, which would mean that it is ready to accept XML from your application. \n\n2. If isReady returns true, the clock.in.xml is then retrieved from the Assets folder, which will be used as the Request XML document. This XML file contains:\n\n\t\t:::xml\n\t\t<wap-provisioningdoc>\n\t\t\t<characteristic type=\"Clock\" version=\"4.2\" >\n\t\t\t\t<parm name=\"AutoTime\" value=\"false\"/>\n\t\t\t\t<parm name=\"TimeZone\" value=\"GMT-5\"/>\n\t\t\t\t<parm name=\"Date\" value=\"2014-12-03\"/>\n\t\t\t\t<parm name=\"Time\" value=\"11:00:00\"/>\n\t\t\t</characteristic>\n\t\t</wap-provisioningdoc>\n\n3. To replace the parms in the Request XML document, an ArrayList must be made to contain ParmValue objects. The ParmValue object is in the XmlParser class and in this example, is instantiated with the Top Level Characteristic type (\"clock\"), the name of the parm that will be edited (\"time\"), and the new value that will be used to replace the original value in the XML (\"11:11:11\"). The Request XML document and the ArrayList of ParmValue objects is used by the XmlParser's replaceParms method, which in this example, will change the \"time\" parm's value to \"11:11:11\". \n\n4. The modified Request XML document is used by the SymbolBrand class's submitXml method, which will submit this XML to the MXMS. This XML will then be sent to the Clock Feature Type, which will change the time of the device to 11:11:11. \n\n5. The MXMS will return a Result XML document is used by the XmlParser's formatXml class to split the Result XML document up onto multiple lines for better readability. \n\n6. The XmlParser's isEquivalent method is then used to check that the Result XML document is equivalent to the Result XML document that was submitted, which would indicate that the device's clock was set successfully. If the XML documents were not equivalent, this indicates that there may have been an error in setting the clock and a characteristic error and/or parm error was returned. \n\n7. If the XML documents are equivalent, this example shows how the XmlParser's fetchParm method can be used to retrieve the value of the \"time\" parm. The Top Level Characteristic type (\"clock\") and the name of the parm who's value will be fetched (\"time\") are used by the fetchParm method to return this parm's value.\n\n\n\t\t:::java\n\t\t// Function to do something by utilizing the MXMS\n\t\tprivate void utilizeMXMS()\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t// Check to see if the MXMS is successfully bound and ready to accept XML\n\t\t\t// Note: Once the binding complete notification (previous code) is passed on, this function will return true\n\t\t\t//       Depending on where this code is called from, this check may or may not be required, but never hurts.\n\t\t\tif ( SymbolBrand.MXMS.isReady() )\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\tLog.d(m_activity.getApplicationInfo().name,\"MXMS.isReady\");\n\n\t\t\t\tString xmlName = \"clock.in.xml\";\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t// Extract an XML snippet from the application assets\n\t\t\t\tString inXml = XmlParser.getAssetXml(m_activity,xmlName);\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t// If the XML was successfully obtained\n\t\t\t\tif ( inXml != null )\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\tLog.i(m_activity.getApplicationInfo().name,\"inXml = \"+inXml);\n\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( xmlName.startsWith(\"clock\") )\n\t\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\t// Replace one or more values in the input XML\n\t\t\t\t\t\tArrayList<ParmValue> replaceValues = new ArrayList<ParmValue>();\n\t\t\t\t\t\treplaceValues.add(new ParmValue(\"clock\",\"time\",\"11:11:11\"));\n\t\t\t\t\t\tString replaceXml = XmlParser.replaceParms(inXml,replaceValues);\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( replaceXml != null )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLog.i(m_activity.getApplicationInfo().name,\"replaceXml = \"+replaceXml);\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinXml = replaceXml;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t// Submit the XML to the MXMS for processing\n\t\t\t\t\t// Note: This will FAIL unless SymbolBrand.MXMS.isReady(), indicating that the binding to the MXMS has completed successfully\n\t\t\t\t\tString outXml = SymbolBrand.MXMS.submitXml(inXml);\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// If we got back result XML\n\t\t\t\t\t// Note: A null result XML is what happens when the binding to the MXMS has NOT completed successfully\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( outXml != null )\n\t\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLog.i(m_activity.getApplicationInfo().name,\"outXml = \"+outXml);\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t// Format the return XML for friendlier display\n\t\t\t\t\t\tString fmtOutXml = XmlParser.formatXml(outXml); \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t// If it was formatted successfully\n\t\t\t\t\t\t// Note: If invalid XML results are passed, the formatting may fail\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( fmtOutXml != null )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLog.i(m_activity.getApplicationInfo().name,\"fmtOutXml = \"+fmtOutXml);\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t// Determine whether the submitted and result XML are equivalent\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( XmlParser.isEquivalent(inXml,outXml) )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLog.i(m_activity.getApplicationInfo().name,\"Submitted and Result XML are Equivalent!\");\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( xmlName.startsWith(\"clock.in\") )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t// Fetch the value of the time parm from the output XML\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tString time = XmlParser.fetchParm(outXml,new ParmSelector(\"clock\",\"time\"));\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t// If we got a non-null value\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( time != null )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLog.i(m_activity.getApplicationInfo().name,\"Set time was \\\"\"+time+\"\\\"\");\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\telse\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tString fmtInXml = XmlParser.formatXml(inXml); \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( fmtInXml != null ) Log.e(m_activity.getApplicationInfo().name,\"inXml = \"+fmtInXml);\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLog.e(m_activity.getApplicationInfo().name,\"fmtOutXml = \"+fmtOutXml);\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLog.e(m_activity.getApplicationInfo().name,\"Submitted and Result XML are NOT Equivalent!\");\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t// Determine whether any top-level characteristic errors were in the result XML\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tint errors = XmlParser.countTlcErrors(outXml);\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif ( errors > 0 )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLog.e(m_activity.getApplicationInfo().name,\"Result XML has \"+errors+\" top level characteristic errors!\");\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\telse\n\t\t\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLog.d(m_activity.getApplicationInfo().name,\"No formatted XML\");\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\telse\n\t\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLog.d(m_activity.getApplicationInfo().name,\"No output XML\");\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\telse\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\tLog.d(m_activity.getApplicationInfo().name,\"No input XML\");\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\n## Querying MX\n\nSubmitting queries to MX follows a similar process to submitting XML that is meant to set the device or perform an action. The SimpleMdmToolKitQuery project, which is supplied in the MDM Toolkit, contains an example of how to submit queries to MX. \n\n1. This example calls the queryMX method from the onServiceConnected instead of the utilizeMXMS method which was used in the previous example.\n\n\t\t:::java\n\t\t// This definition is mandatory to track binding to the MXMS\n\t\tprivate ServiceConnection mMxFrameworkServiceConnection = new ServiceConnection()\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t// Callback to notify when binding to the MXMS has completed\n\t\t\tpublic void onServiceConnected(ComponentName className,IBinder service)\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t// Pass the binding notification on so the helper class can know the service was bound\n\t\t\t\tSymbolBrand.MXMS.onServiceConnected(className,service);\n\n\t\t\t\t// For the purposes of this test application, we call this from here because this is the FIRST time it can be done\n\t\t\t\t// In a real world situation, it might be called repeatedly from other locations, as things that need to be done are identified\n\t\t\t\tqueryMX();\n\n\t\t\t\t// Call term \n\t\t\t\tSymbolBrand.MXMS.term(m_activity,mMxFrameworkServiceConnection);\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t// Exit the application\n\t\t\t\tm_activity.finish();\t    \t\t\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t// Callback to notify when unbinding from the MXMS has occurred\n\t\t\tpublic void onServiceDisconnected(ComponentName className)\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t// Pass the unbinding notification on so the helper class can know the service was unbound\n\t\t\t\tSymbolBrand.MXMS.onServiceDisconnected(className);\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t};  \n\n2. In the queryMX method, if isReady returns true, the mx.in3.xml is then retrieved from the Assets folder, which will be used as the Request XML document. This XML file contains:\n\n\t\t:::xml\n\t\t<wap-provisioningdoc>\n\t\t\t<characteristic-query type=\"MX\"/>\n\t\t</wap-provisioningdoc>\n\t\t\n3. The Request XML document is used by the SymbolBrand class's submitXml method, which will submit this XML to the MXMS. This XML will then be sent to the MX Feature Type, which will return the version number of MXMS.\n\n5. The MXMS will return a Result XML document which is then used by the XmlParser's fetchParm method to retreive and output the value of the \"MXMFVersion\" and \"Version\" parms.\n\n6. This sample project also shows similar code which would let you query the CspMgr Feature Type, which would return an enumerated list of the available Feature Types. There are also examples on how to use the other XMLs in the project's Assets folder to query other Feature Types, such as the CameraMgr, DisplayMgr, DevAdmin, DhcpOptionMgr, and EncryptMgr, to receive back information about the current settings of the device. \n\n\t\t:::java\n\t\t// Function to query MX version(s)\n\t\tprivate void queryMX()\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t// Check to see if the MXMS is successfully bound and ready to accept XML\n\t\t\t// Note: Once the binding complete notification (previous code) is passed on, this function will return true\n\t\t\t//       Depending on where this code is called from, this check may or may not be required, but never hurts.\n\t\t\tif ( SymbolBrand.MXMS.isReady() )\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\tLog.d(m_activity.getApplicationInfo().name,\"MXMS.isReady\");\n\n\t\t\t\t// Extract an XML snippet from the application assets\n\t\t\t\t//String inXml = XmlParser.getAssetXml(m_activity,\"mx.in1.xml\");\n\t\t\t\t//String inXml = XmlParser.getAssetXml(m_activity,\"mx.in2.xml\");\n\t\t\t\tString inXml = XmlParser.getAssetXml(m_activity,\"mx.in3.xml\");\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t// If the XML was successfully obtained\n\t\t\t\tif ( inXml != null )\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\tLog.d(m_activity.getApplicationInfo().name,\"inXml = \"+inXml);\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// Submit the XML to the MXMS for processing\n\t\t\t\t\t// Note: This will FAIL unless SymbolBrand.MXMS.isReady(), indicating that the binding to the MXMS has completed successfully\n\t\t\t\t\tString outXml = SymbolBrand.MXMS.submitXml(inXml);\n\n\t\t\t\t\t// If we got back result XML\n\t\t\t\t\t// Note: A null result XML is what happens when the binding to the MXMS has NOT completed successfully\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( outXml != null )\n\t\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLog.d(m_activity.getApplicationInfo().name,\"outXml = \"+outXml);\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tString queryVersion = XmlParser.fetchParm(outXml,new ParmSelector(\"\",\"MXMFVersion\"));\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif (queryVersion != null )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLog.i(m_activity.getApplicationInfo().name,\"MXMF version = \" + queryVersion);\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\telse\n\t\t\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLog.d(m_activity.getApplicationInfo().name,\"MX query returned no MXMF version\");\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tqueryVersion = XmlParser.fetchParm(outXml,new ParmSelector(\"\",\"Version\"));\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif (queryVersion != null )\n\t\t\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLog.i(m_activity.getApplicationInfo().name,\"Version = \" + queryVersion);\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\telse\n\t\t\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLog.d(m_activity.getApplicationInfo().name,\"MX query returned no version\");\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\telse\n\t\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLog.d(m_activity.getApplicationInfo().name,\"MX query returned no results\");\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\n\n\n<!--\nThe following sample code shows how to submit XML that was created in the previous step to the MX Framework as a string.

It also uses this same format when sending back responses to the client making the request. The XML needs to be structured in a standardized format. In order to help understand this format, we have included a DSDtoXML tool with this toolkit to be used to generate sample XML. Typically you would require that some values be changed dynamically on the device by your client application. So you would therefore manipulate the values of specific parameter attributes within your code based on the specific template you have generated. \n\nA typical approach to XML generation may include:\n\n* Use the DSDtoXML tool to generate several XML templates for the features you wish to include in your client\n* Include these templates either in your device client or server code depending on your scheme for setting values\n* Edit the values inside specific parameter attributes accordingly (typically parameters with text values)\n* Submit the XML from your client application that has been enabled for MX communication\n\n\n\n## DSD Files\n\nDSD Files are XML documents that define the schema a CSP uses to configure settings on a device. Each CSP has a matching DSD document. Each version of the MX Framework includes a set of CSPs that include a specific feature set. When generating XML for a CSP, be sure to consider the version of MX that you are working with. The DSDs included with the MDM Toolkit can be found in the `MX` folder. Within the `MX` folder, there will be versions of MX along with a `DSD` subfolder. \n\n![img](images/dsdfiles.jpg)\n\n\n### DSD-Driven Programmatic XML Generation\n\nA powerful and extensible, but fairly complex, method for creating conformant XML is to drive generation of XML directly from a DSD. This method is most valuable for an MDM Server that is likely to possess the requisite processing resources. This method could be used to support cases where the MDM Server wishes to present its own Data-Driven UI to allow an MDM Administrator to enable the creation of XML that is conformant to a selected DSD. It also could be used to support cases where the MDM Server needs to programmatically generate XML and wants to drive this from the DSD to avoid the need to change the code if a DSD is added or modified. This method requires that the DSD be parsed and interpreted by the MDM Server code. Since the processing of DSDs can be quite complex, use of this technique is not currently supported by the EMDK for MDMs. Future versions of the EMDK for MDMs may support this method by supplying code libraries that can be called directly from MDM Servers.\n\n### XML Templates\n\nA simple and quite useful method for creating conformant XML is to use XML Templates and Parm Value Substitution. An XML Template is XML that is \"hand generated\" using a tool that can present a Data-Driven UI based on a DSD. An XML Template may address the needs of a particular use case by making specific decisions about the values of specific Pivotal Parms. A single CSP may require many XML Templates if the CSP can be used to satisfy many different use cases. An MDM that wants to use a CSP needs to understand the use cases that CSP can support and which of them are of value to be leveraged by that MDM. For each use case that a CSP supports and that an MDM wishes to leverage, a suitable XML Template will likely need to be generated.\n\n#### XML Templates and Parm Substitution\n\nWhen an MDM uses XML Templates, a given use case is likely to involve one or more Non-Pivotal Parms. \n\nA Non-Pivotal Parm is simply a parm where the value selected or entered has no impact on subsequent SGCs or parms. When an XML Template is \"hand generated\" for a given Use Case using a tool, it will often be necessary to enter \"valid\" values for one or more Non-Pivotal Parms. Since the XML Template is intended to be generic for a given Use Case, any valid \"placeholder\" values can be entered for Non-Pivotal Parms. When an XML Template is used to implement its associated Use Case, Parm Value Substitution can be used to replace the \"placeholder\" values of Non-Pivotal Parms with the actual values required to customize that XML Template to produce the proper result. It is an important aspect of the XML used by MXMS that a given parm can only appear ONCE within a given TLC since this can make it much easier to locate and perform replacement of the values of \"placeholder\" values of Non-Pivotal Parms within an XML Template.\n\n#### Management Functions and XML Templates\n\nXML Templates and Parm Value Substitution can be quite useful when XML will be created by the MDM Server or the MSP Agent. This can be accomplished via a process such as:\n\n* Determine the list of management functions that need to be supported by the MDM\n* Determine which use case of which CSP can be used to implement each identified management function\n* Generate an XML Template for each required use case \n* Embed the XML Template for each required use case into the code of the MDM Server or MDM Agent, as appropriate, and associate it logically with the associated management function\n\nTo perform a given management function:\n\n1. Obtain the parameter data required to perform that management function.\n2. Select the XML Template associated with that management function.\n3. Use Parm Value Substitution to customize the XML Template with the parameter data to generate XML to perform the desired management function.\n4. If the MDM Server is generating the XML, deliver the generated XML to the MSP Agent for submission to the MXMS. If the MSP Agent is generating the XML, submit the generated XML to the MXMS.\n\n\n\n## Using DSDtoXML Tool\n\nThe DSDtoXML tool, `DSDtoXML.jar`, is used for generating XML configuration files and templates. It is located in the `DSD To XML` folder of the MDM Toolkit\n\n![img](images/dsdtoolfolder.jpg)\n\n###Prerequisites\n\n* Java JVM Installed\n* DSDtoXML.jar\n* DSD Files\n\n### Generating XML\n\n1. Start the jar file \"DSDtoXML.jar\" located in the folder \"DSD To XML\". You will be presented with a file select dialog.  \n![img](images/xmlgendialog.jpg)\n2. Select the DSD file for the corresponding CSP you wish to configure and click \"Open\". For this example we will be using \"Clock.dsd\".  \n![img](images/xmlgenclock.jpg)\n3. Set the values you wish to configure via MX. For this example we will be setting, Date, Time, and time Zone.  \n![img](images/xmlgensetvalues.jpg)\n4. When complete, click the button \"Save XML\".  \n![img](images/xmlgensavebutton.jpg)\n5. Select a location to save your XML configuration file on your computer, give it a name, and select \"Save\".  \n![img](images/xmlgensavelocation.jpg)\n6. You can now open the file with a text or XML editor to view the generated XML. For this example this is the XML output:\n\n    \t:::xml\n\t\t<wap-provisioningdoc>\n\t\t\t<characteristic type=\"Clock\" version=\"4.2\" >\n\t\t\t\t<parm name=\"AutoTime\" value=\"false\"/>\n\t\t\t\t<parm name=\"TimeZone\" value=\"GMT-5\"/>\n\t\t\t\t<parm name=\"Date\" value=\"2014-12-03\"/>\n\t\t\t\t<parm name=\"Time\" value=\"17:00:00\"/>\n\t\t\t</characteristic>\n\t\t</wap-provisioningdoc>\n\n>Note: Notice the relationship with the `parm` attributes and associated `value`. \n\n### About CSP XML Parms \n\nIn order to make sure your XML is well structured and follows the MX Framework definition. It is recommended that the XML be constructed using the DSDtoXML tool. The XML structure contains a possible tree of `characteristic` and `parm` attributes along with their values. Each CSP will generate a different XML tree based on how the CSP has grouped features together. By comparing the XML generated to the values you choose within the DSDtoXML tool will give you a way to identify the values that you may need to change dynamically. Typically the values that the MDM client will change will be the free form text fields. It is not recommended that other types of characteristics are changed dynamically. A set of XML characteristic and parm uages can be found in the associated CSP RTF file found in the `RTF` folder. You can also generate this document using the DSDtoXML tool by  selecting the \"Save RTF\" button. \n\n>Note: Notice in the example below we are using the DSDtoXML tool to generate a Wi-Fi profile to add a new Wi-Fi network. In the tool we put in placeholder text that we can replace with our MDM client code before submitting the XML to the MX framework.\n\n![img](images/xmlgenrelationship.jpg)\n\n### Switching DSD Documents\n\nMost likely, you will need to generate multiple sets of XML segments associated with each task that the MDM client wishes to expose. To accomplish this, you will need to load DSD files separately. You can select another DSD at any time by clicking the button `Load DSD`. \n\n![img](images/xmlgenloaddsdbutton.jpg)\n\n>Note:   \n>All current settings will be lost. \n\n### Resetting Configuration\n\nAt any time while configuring MX settings you can reset the settings to their default values by clicking \"Reset\".\n\n![img](images/xmlgenresetbutton.jpg)\n\n>Note:   \n>All current settings will be lost. \n\n### Quitting the Application\n\nTo quit the application click the button \"Quit\". \n\n![img](images/xmlgenquitbutton.jpg)\n\n>Note:   \n>All current settings will be lost. \n\n### Limitations\n\n* In addition to setting device configurations, MX can be used to set query for device information. Currently this tool cannot generate Query XML. \n\n## Modifying Values\n\nOnce the XML template has been generated, it is very likely your MDM client will want to modify some of the values dynamically. As you get familiar with different CSPs, you will see that when some options are selected, another group of options are presented. Some of the fields of the newly presented options may be required in order for it to be successfully processed. Generating the corresponding XML within your MDM client code would be quite complex and prone to error. Therefore, it is recommended that the DSDtoXML tool be used to generate each of these \"decision points\" to develop a very modular approach to XML submission. Then the values that need to be changed dynamically would simply reside in the text fields that are shown in the DSDtoXMl tool. This value would then simply be replaced in the XML in the MDM client application.\n\nFor example, let's say we needed to install and uninstall a series of applications as well as change the default launcher for the device. We would launch the DSDtoXML tool and develop a few XML modules:\n\n* Install Application\n* Uninstall Application\n* Set Default Launcher\n\nThe **Install Application** XML module would look something like:\n\n\t:::xml\n\t<wap-provisioningdoc>\n\t\t<characteristic type=\"AppMgr\" version=\"4.2\" >\n\t\t\t<parm name=\"Action\" value=\"Install\"/>\n\t\t\t<parm name=\"APK\" value=\"/storage/sdcard1/placeholder-install.apk\"/>\n\t\t</characteristic>\n\t</wap-provisioningdoc>\n\nThe MDM client would use this XML module for each application it wishes to install and replace the `APK` parm's value `/storage/sdcard1/placeholder.apk` each time with the 'real' value.\n\nThe **Uninstall Application** XML module would look something like:\n\n\t:::xml\n\t<wap-provisioningdoc>\n\t\t<characteristic type=\"AppMgr\" version=\"4.2\" >\n\t\t\t<parm name=\"Action\" value=\"Uninstall\"/>\n\t\t\t<parm name=\"Package\" value=\"com.mycompany.placeholder\"/>\n\t\t</characteristic>\n\t</wap-provisioningdoc>\n\nNotice that this XML looks very similar to the previous one, but the `Action` parm has changed to `Uninstall`. This in turn, has also changed the parm to `Package` as opposed to `APK` that was used in the install XML above. Instead of trying to develop this XML within the MDM client code, we would just have a corresponding XML module generated by the DSDtoXML tool for our 'uninstall' action and then replace the  `Package` parm's value from `com.mycompany.placeholder` to the actual package that we wish to remove.\n\nOur **Default launcher** XML module looks very similar to the Uninstall one we just discussed:\n\n\t:::xml\n\t<wap-provisioningdoc>\n\t\t<characteristic type=\"AppMgr\" version=\"4.2\" >\n\t\t\t<parm name=\"Action\" value=\"SetDefaultLauncher\"/>\n\t\t\t<parm name=\"Package\" value=\"com.mycompany.placeholder-launcher\"/>\n\t\t</characteristic>\n\t</wap-provisioningdoc>\n\nNotice just the `Action` parm's value has changed.\n\n## XML Queries\n\nAt this time, the DSDtoXML tool does not generate XML that can be used for queries. Each CSP reference document within this MDM Toolkit documentation may include a section on query XML depending on whether it supports any query abilities. Future versions of the MDM toolkit and MX framework, may contain the ability to generate queries by using the corresponding DSD file and updated DSDtoXML tool."},{"key":"guide-xml-queries","name":" XML Queries","md":"# XML Queries\n\nThis guide will describes how to query MX for framework and device information:\n\n* Component Versions\n* Installed CSPs\n* CSP Attributes\n* Grouping Queries\n\n> Note: This version of the MDM toolkit provides limited support for query abilities. The DSDtoXML tool currently does not support generating the needed query XML. Query support will be shown under a given CSP reference within this document if the CSP supports querying it's parameters. Below are some generic queries that are available at the framework level.\n\n## CSP Query System  \n\nThe CSP query system allows a developer to query the MX Framework for information about the device and the state of the device. CSPs can be queried based off characteristics or parameters. Each CSP may or may not support querying of individual parameters and characteristics. You will need to check the CSP reference found in this guide to see what querying capabilities it supports. \n\n### Parameter Query Example\n\nExample Input: \n\n    :::xml\n

The required parsing can be simplified by taking advantage of the following aspects of MXMS XML: \n\n* All three types of behaviors (Set Configuration, Perform Action, and Query Configuration) have the same format for their Result XML documents\n* The presence of TLC errors and the (absence of) XML equivalence can be used to quickly separate successes from failures\n* If an operation was performed, but not exactly as requested, Parm Value Extraction can be used to compare requested and resulting values to determine any deviation\n* When an XML query is issued, Parm Value Extraction can be used to extract key values that were the primary purpose of the XML query \n\nThis document will describe how to handle response from MX:\n\n* Success Response\n* Error Responses\n\n## Parm Value Extraction\n\nA simple and quite useful method for simplifying the extraction of relevant information from an XML Result document is Parm Value Extraction. It is simply the process of searching an XML document for a parm with a given name and extracting the value associated with it. Parm Value Extraction is most commonly applied to Non-Pivotal Parms since they are the mostly likely to contain useful information. This is because Pivotal Parms are typically \"canned\" as part of an XML Template used to create an Request XML document and are simply replicated into the Result XML document. It is an important aspect of the XML used by MXMS that a given parm can only appear once within a given TLC since this can make it much easier to extract of the value of a given named parm from within a Result XML document.\n\n## Success Response\n\nIf the call to MX is successful, the XML returned from MX will exactly match the XML sent to MX.   \n\nXML Submitted\n\n    :::xml\n    <wap-provisioningdoc>\n        <characteristic type=\"Clock\" version=\"4.3\">\n            <parm name=\"AutoTime\" value=\"false\"/>\n            <parm name=\"TimeZone\" value=\"GMT-5\"/>\n            <parm name=\"Date\" value=\"2014-01-19\"/>\n            <parm name=\"Time\" value=\"17:00:00\"/>\n        </characteristic>\n    </wap-provisioningdoc>\n\nXML Returned\n\n\t:::xml\n    <wap-provisioningdoc>\n        <characteristic type=\"Clock\" version=\"4.3\">\n            <parm name=\"AutoTime\" value=\"false\"/>\n            <parm name=\"TimeZone\" value=\"GMT-5\"/>\n            <parm name=\"Date\" value=\"2014-01-19\"/>\n            <parm name=\"Time\" value=\"17:00:00\"/>\n        </characteristic>\n    </wap-provisioningdoc>\n\n\n## Error Responses \n\nEach CSP will handle errors according to their specific implementation. If the call to MX fails the response XML will contain information about the failure and contain the text \"-error\". Overall, there are a few common error types:\n\n* Framework Error\n* CSP Error\n* Sub Characteristic Error\n* Parm Error\n\n### Framework Error\nThe MX framework typically passes the submitted XML directly to the CSP, but may return errors if a CSP is not found or if the XML is malformed in general. Below is an example:\n\n\nXML Submitted\n\n    :::xml\n    <wap-provisioningdoc>\n        <characteristic type=\"SomeCSP\" version=\"4.3\">\n            <parm name=\"SomeParm\" value=\"false\"/>\n        </characteristic>\n    </wap-provisioningdoc>\n\nXML Returned\n\n    :::xml\n    <wap-provisioningdoc>\n        <characteristic-error type=\"SomeCSP\" version=\"4.3\" desc=\" has not registered with MX Framework yet\">\n            <parm name=\"SomeParm\" value=\"false\"/>\n        </characteristic-error>\n    </wap-provisioningdoc>\n\n### CSP Error\nA CSP is considered a 'top-level characteristic' within the context of the XML. An error indicated at this level is considered a major error by the CSP and typically means that none of the parms were processed. \n\nBelow is an example:\n\nXML Submitted\n\n    :::xml\n    <wap-provisioningdoc>\n        <characteristic type=\"Clock\" version=\"100\" >\n            <parm name=\"AutoTime\" value=\"true\"/>\n        </characteristic>\n    </wap-provisioningdoc>\n\n\nXML Returned\n\n    :::xml\n    <wap-provisioningdoc>\n        <characteristic-error type=\"Clock\" version=\"100\" desc=\"The DSD version is higher than current supported DSD 4.3\">\n            <parm name=\"AutoTime\" value=\"true\"/>\n        </characteristic-error>\n    </wap-provisioningdoc>\n\n>Note: The XML CSP enables you to control how MX will handle top-level characteristic errors. Consult the XML CSP reference in this guide for more information.\n\n### Sub Characteristic Error\nSome CSPs contain 'sub-characteristics' which provide for a grouping of settings to be applied to a specific feature of the CSP. The CSP may report a `characteristic-error` at this level when all settings within that sub-characteristic have failed to be applied. Other settings outside of the sub-characteristic may have been applied. Below is an example:\n\n\nXML Submitted\n\n    :::xml\n    <wap-provisioningdoc>\n        <characteristic type=\"Clock\" version=\"4.3\" >\n            <parm name=\"AutoTime\" value=\"true\"/>\n            <characteristic type=\"AutoTimeDetails\">\n                <parm name=\"somParm\" value=\"00:30:00\"/>\n            </characteristic>\n        </characteristic>\n    </wap-provisioningdoc>\n\nXML Returned\n\n    :::xml\n    <wap-provisioningdoc>\n        <characteristic type=\"Clock\" version=\"4.3\">\n            <parm name=\"AutoTime\" value=\"true\"/>\n            <characteristic-error type=\"AutoTimeDetails\" desc=\"unsupported\">\n                <parm-error name=\"someParm\" value=\"00:30:00\" desc=\"Param type is not supported\"/>\n            </characteristic-error>\n        </characteristic>\n    </wap-provisioningdoc>\n\n\n### Parm Error\nSome CSPs may report a `parm-error` when that setting for that specific parm have failed to be applied. Other settings outside of parm may have been applied. Below is an example:\n\n\nXML Submitted\n\n    :::xml\n    <wap-provisioningdoc>\n        <characteristic type=\"Clock\" version=\"4.3\">\n            <parm name=\"SomeParm\" value=\"false\"/>\n        </characteristic>\n    </wap-provisioningdoc>\n\nXML Returned\n\n    :::xml\n    <wap-provisioningdoc>\n        <characteristic type=\"Clock\" version=\"4.3\">\n            <parm-error name=\"SomeParm\" value=\"false\" desc=\"Param type is not supported\"/>\n        </characteristic>\n    </wap-provisioningdoc>\n\n## Notes\n\nXML sent into and returned from MX may differ in white spacing both before and after XML nodes and within XML nodes. When comparing returned XML to submitted XML you should format the white spacing to a unified pattern before making comparisons.

You will need to use the same reference that you established in your MX binding code.\n\n    :::java\n    //MX can through exceptions when processing XML \n\ttry {\n\t    //Check if the MX service is null \n\t    if(MXservice != null){\n\t        //MX Response XML\n\t\t\tString MxResXML = \"\";\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t//MX XML\n\t\t\tString MxXML = \"<wap-provisioningdoc>\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t +     \"<characteristic type=\\\"Clock\\\" version=\\\"4.2\\\">\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t +         \"<parm name=\\\"AutoTime\\\" value=\\\"false\\\"/>\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t +         \"<parm name=\\\"TimeZone\\\" value=\\\"GMT-5\\\"/>\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t +         \"<parm name=\\\"Date\\\" value=\\\"2013-11-19\\\"/>\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t +         \"<parm name=\\\"Time\\\" value=\\\"10:10:10\\\"/>\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t +     \"</characteristic>\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t + \"</wap-provisioningdoc>\";\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t//Send XML to MX for processing \n\t\t\tMxResXML = MXservice.processXML(MxXML);\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t//Log result XML\n\t\t    Log.i(\"MX\", \"MxResXML: \" + MxResXML);\n\t    }\n\t    else{\n\t        Log.e(\"MX\", \"Service is null\");\n\t    }\n\t} \n\tcatch (Exception e) {\n\t    Log.e(\"MX\", e.toString());\n    }\n\n## Multiple Characteristics\n\nYou can combine multiple settings together inside on `wap-provisioningdoc` by including multiple `characteristic` XML that was generated individually. These settings will be applied in the order they are represented in the file. Further handling can be controlled by the [XML Manager](#csp-xml) that can control behavior of error handling.  \n\nFor example we will set the date and time as two separate instructions as well as add a new WiFi network:\n\n    :::xml\n    <wap-provisioningdoc>\n\t    <characteristic type=\"Clock\" version=\"4.2\">\n\t\t    <parm name=\"AutoTime\" value=\"false\">\n\t\t\t<parm name=\"Date\" value=\"2013-11-19\">\n        </characteristic>\n        <characteristic type=\"Clock\" version=\"4.2\">\n\t\t    <parm name=\"AutoTime\" value=\"false\">\n\t\t\t<parm name=\"Time\" value=\"10:10:10\">\n        </characteristic>\n\t\t<characteristic type=\"Wi-Fi\" version=\"2.7\" >\n\t\t\t<parm name=\"UseRegulatory\" value=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t<parm name=\"UseAdvancedOptions\" value=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t<parm name=\"NetworkAction\" value=\"Add\"/>\n\t\t\t<characteristic type=\"network-profile\">\n\t\t\t\t<parm name=\"SSID\" value=\"PLACEHODLER-SSID\"/>\n\t\t\t\t<parm name=\"SecurityMode\" value=\"2\"/>\n\t\t\t\t<parm name=\"WPAMode\" value=\"1\"/>\n\t\t\t\t<parm name=\"Authentication\" value=\"1\"/>\n\t\t\t\t<characteristic type=\"auth-details\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<parm name=\"OptionalServerCertificate\" value=\"\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t<parm name=\"MandatoryClientCertificate\" value=\"\"/>\n\t\t\t\t</characteristic>\n\t\t\t\t<parm name=\"UseDHCP\" value=\"1\"/>\n\t\t\t\t<parm name=\"UseProxy\" value=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t</characteristic>\n\t\t</characteristic>\n\n    </wap-provisioningdoc>"},{"key":"guide-xml-xmlparser","name":" XML Parser ","md":"# XML Parser \n\n## Overview\n\nThe XML Parser class is a Java class for assisting with MX XML on Android. It has been developed to assist in starting MX development, and to offer suggestion as to how your application might process MX XML. Your application does not need to use the XML Parser class. It is up to your development teams to determine the best way for your application to handle MX XML for your needs. \n\n## Main Features\n\n### Validate Set Responses\n\nThe XML Parser class can assist you in validating responses from MX through the help of the `isXmlEquivalent` function. When an MX set is successful the response XML should be equivalent to the set XML, besides for white space. To use the `isXmlEquivalent` function pass in the XML string you have submitted to MX and the XML string response from MX. If the XML is equivalent, the function will return `true` if not it will return `false`. If the function  returns `false` it should contain error parms or characteristics.\n\nFor Example:\n\n    :::java\n    //Check for Errors\n    Boolean isXmlGood = XmlParser.isXmlEquivalent(XML, resXML);\n\n### Validate Query Responses \n\nThe XML Parser class assist you in validating query responses from MX through the help of the `isQueryXmlResponseValid` function. You can pass in the response XML from MX and if the XML is error free it will return `true` if there is an error it will return `false`. \n\nFor Example:\n\n    :::java\n    //Check for Errors\n\tBoolean isXmlGood = XmlParser.isQueryXmlResponseValid(resXML);\n\n### Counting Errors in Response XML\n\nThe XML Parser class helps you count the number of errors in the XML returned from the MX framework through the use of the function `countCharErrors` and `countParmErrors`. Both functions take in the response XML string from MX and return the number of errors of their specified type. \n\nFor Example: \n\n    :::java\n    //Count Errors \n    int charErrors = XmlParser.countCharErrors(resXML);\n    int parmErrors = XmlParser.countParmErrors(resXML);\n\n### Modifying XML Documents\n\nThe XML Parser class helps you modify MX XML. For example you can use it to replace values in a template XML with values given to your program through a user input. The function `replaceParms` allows you to specify the XML string to modify, the list of MX parm values to set, and outputs the updated XML string. \n\nFor Example:\n\n    :::java\n    //Setup parm value\n\tParmValue parmValue = new ParmValue(\"charType\", \"parmName\", \"value\");\n\t    \t\t\t\t \n\t//Setup parm value array list\n\tArrayList<ParmValue> parmValues = new ArrayList<ParmValue>();\n\t    \t\t\t\t \n\t//Add parm value\n\tparmValues.add(parmValue);\n\t    \t\t\t\t \n\t//Modify XML\n\tString newXML = XmlParser.replaceParms(xml, parmValues);\n\n### Reading XML Documents\n\nThe XML Parser class helps you read MX XML through the use of the `fetchParms` function. For example you can use this function to confirm parm values in set XML or read parm values in query xml. To use this function pass in the XML and a list of parm selectors, and the function will return an array list of parm values. \n\nFor Example:\n\n    :::java\n    //Setup parm selector\n\tParmSelector parmSelector = new ParmSelector(\"charType\", \"parmName\");\n\t    \t\t\t\t \n\t//Setup parm value array list\n\tArrayList<ParmSelector> parmSelectors = new ArrayList<ParmSelector>();\n\t    \t\t\t\t \n\t//Add parm value\n\tparmSelectors.add(parmSelector);\n\t    \t\t\t\t \n\t//Get parm values\n\tArrayList<ParmValue> parmValues = XmlParser.fetchParms(xml, parmSelectors);\n\n## Main Methods\n\n### boolean isXmlEquivalent(String inXml,String outXml)\n\nFunction for comparing if two MX XML's are equivalent, this can be used for validating set results\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n**inXml-** XML submitted to MX\n\n**outXml-** XML revived from MX\n\n**Returns:** boolean- True if XML is equivalent false if XMLs are different \n\n### boolean isQueryXmlResponseValid(String resXml)\n\nChecks Query response XML for Errors\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n**resXml**- XML to check for errors\n\n**Returns:** boolean- True for no errors false for errors \n\n### String formatXml(String xml)\n\nFormats XML to eliminate XML formatting issues in XML Nodes\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n**xml**- XML to format\n\n**Returns:** String- Cleaned XML\n\n### int countCharErrors(String xml)\n\nCounts the number of characteristic errors in a block of MX XML\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n**xml**- XML to count errors on\n\n**Returns:** int- Number of errors\n\n### int countParmErrors(String xml)\n\nCounts the number of parm errors in a block of MX XML\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n**xml**- XML to count errors on\n\n**Returns:** int- Number of errors\n\n### String getParmQuery(String charType,String parmName)\n\nHelper function for creating a parm query\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n**charType**- Characteristic type\n\n**parmName**- Parm Name to query \n\n**Returns:** String- MX query XML\n\n### String getCharQuery(String charType)\n\nHelper function for creating a characteristic query\n\n**Parameters:** \n\n**charType**- Characteristic type\n\n**Returns:** String- MX query XML\n\n### String replaceParms(String xml,ArrayList<ParmValue> values)\n\nUpdates XML with specified parm changes \n\n**Parameters:**\n\n**xml**- XML to update\n\n**values**- Values to replace\n\n**Returns:** String- Updated XML\n\n###  ArrayList<ParmValue> fetchParms(String xml,ArrayList<ParmSelector> selectors)\n\nFind parm value in xml\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n**xml**- XML to find parms in\n\n**selectors**- Parm selectors to find \n\n**Returns:** String- List of parm selector values or null on error\n\n### String fetchParm(String xml,ParmSelector selector)\n\nFind parm value in xml\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n**xml**- XML to find parm in\n\n**selector**- Parm selector\n\n**Returns:** String- Parm value\n\n## XML Parser Class\n\n    :::java\n    package com.example.mdmtester;\n\n\timport java.io.BufferedReader;\n\timport java.io.ByteArrayInputStream;\n\timport java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream;\n\timport java.io.IOException;\n\timport java.io.InputStream;\n\timport java.io.OutputStream;\n\timport java.io.StringReader;\n\timport java.util.ArrayList;\n\timport java.util.Properties;\n\timport javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory;\n\timport javax.xml.transform.OutputKeys;\n\timport javax.xml.transform.Transformer;\n\timport javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory;\n\timport javax.xml.transform.dom.DOMSource;\n\timport javax.xml.transform.stream.StreamResult;\n\timport org.w3c.dom.Document;\n\timport org.w3c.dom.NamedNodeMap;\n\timport org.w3c.dom.Node;\n\timport android.app.Activity;\n\timport android.content.res.AssetManager;\n\n\t/** \n\t * Helper class for working with MX XML\n\t */\n\tpublic class XmlParser\n\t{\n\t\t//Variables\n\t\tstatic private ArrayList<ParmSelector> m_selectors;\n\t\tstatic private ArrayList<ParmValue> m_values;\n\t\tstatic private String m_fetchParm;\n\t\tstatic private int m_countCharErrors;\n\t\tstatic private int m_countParmErrors;\n\t\tstatic private String m_char;\n\n\t\t/**\n\t\t * Takes in a list of parm selectors and returns the value for that parm \n\t\t * @param xml XML to find parms in\n\t\t * @param selectors Parm selectors to find \n\t\t * @return List of parm selector values or null on error\n\t\t */\n\t\tstatic public ArrayList<ParmValue> fetchParms(String xml,ArrayList<ParmSelector> selectors)\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tif ( xml == null ) return null;\n\t\t\tif ( selectors == null ) return null;\n\t\t\tif ( selectors.size() == 0 ) return null;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tDocParser parser = new DocParser(xml)\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t@Override public boolean test(Node node)\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\tif ( isChar(node) && !isChar(node.getParentNode()) ) m_char = getCharType(node);\n\t\t\t\t\treturn isParm(node);\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t@Override public void process(Node node)\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\tString name = getParmName(node);

PROV DTD is the XML schema used by the OMA CP (Open Mobile Alliance Client Provisioning) Standard. Use of this XML schema means that XML that can be consumed by MXMS will be familiar to MDM Vendors that are already familiar with OMA CP and/or the PROV DTD. Use of this XML schema also means that MXMS can be more easily leveraged by existing MDMs that are based on or can already leverage OMA CP.\n\n## XML Elements\n\n### Characteristics\n\nA characteristic is an element that appears in an XML document or DSD and that is used to define hierarchical organization of parms and characteristics. \n\nTop-Level Characteristics (TLCs) must appear at the outermost level of a document (XML or DSD). Every XML document must contain at least one TLC and every DSD must contain **exactly one** TLC. There is a one to one mapping between TLCs and DSDs/CSPs. The type of a TLC specified in the XML or DSD exactly matches the CSP name. A Request TLC appears in a Request XML Document to specify one or more Set Configuration and/or Perform Action Behaviors. A Result TLC provides information about the success or failure of the behavior(s) requested by the corresponding Request TLC.\n\nSub-Group Characteristic (SGCs) may appear in TLCs/SGCs. A TLC may have any number (including zero) of SGCs and an SGC may have any number (including zero) of SGCs. A Request SGC provides information about a behavior to be performed by its enclosing Result TLC. A Result SGC provides information about the behavior performed for its enclosing Result SGC.\n\n### Characteristic-Errors\n\nA Characteristic-Error is an element that appears in a Result XML document that is used to indicate a failure when processing a corresponding characteristic in a Request XML document. \n\nTop-Level Characteristic-Errors (TLC Errors) are those that appear at the outermost level of a Result XML document. A Result XML document may contain zero or more TLC errors. If a Result XML document contains a TLC error, it indicates that the corresponding characteristic in the Request XML document was completely rejected. This means that none of the behaviors requested by that TLC were performed by the CSP. \n\nSub-Group Characteristic-Errors (SGC Errors) are those that appear within TLCs/SGCs. If a TLC or SGC in a Result XML document contains an SGC error, it indicates that the Behavior requested by the corresponding SGC was rejected. This means a that portion of the behavior requested by the enclosing TLC was not performed by the CSP.\n\n### Characteristic-Queries\n\nA Characteristic-Query is an element that appears in a Request XML document that is used to request a query of some or all of the current configurations of the features in the subsystem that are managed by a CSP.\n\nTop-Level Queries (TLQs) must appear at the outermost level of an XML document. A Request XML document may contain zero or more TLQs. A TLQ cannot contain any sub-elements. A TLQ in a Request XML document will result in a TLC or TLC error in the corresponding location in the Result XML document.\n\nSub-Group Queries (SGQs) may appear in TLCs/SGCs. An SGQ must appear within a TLC or a SGC (never within another query). It may contain a parm to act as a query index to select which configuration to query. A request SGQ in a Request XML document will either result in a Characteristic-Query-Error or in the matching SGC in the corresponding location in the Result XML Document.\n\n### Characteristic-Query-Errors\n\nA Characteristic-Query-Error is an element that appears in a Result XML document that is used to indicate that a failure occurred when processing a corresponding Characteristic-Query element in a Request XML document. This could occur because the TLC or SGC being queried does not support Characteristic-Query. This could also occur because the SGC being queried requires a query index and none was supplied or the query index parm supplied did not have a value that selected a valid configuration to query.\n\n### Parms\n\nA parm is an element that appears in a Request XML document or a Result XML document and that is used to hold a single data item. Every parm must have a name that is unique within a given TLC (even across different SGCs within that TLC). A given parm can appear only once within a given TLC. It may appear more than once within an XML document as long as that XML document contains multiple TLCs and that parm appears only once within each TLC.\n\nA parm is the desired configuration and a desired action selector or action parameter value when it is a part of a Request XML document for a Set Configuration behavior. It is also used to represent the current configuration value of a feature on the device when it is part of a Result XML document for a Query Configuration behavior.\n\nIf the processing of a parm in a Request XML document by a CSP is successful, then the Result XML document will contain a Parm element, which typically will have the same value. The Parm element may have a different value in the Result XML document if the CSP determined that the value requested was not supported but was \"close enough\" to a supported value that substituting the closest supported value was reasonable. In such a case, the value actually used will be returned in the parm in the Result XML document instead of the value requested.\n\n### Parm-errors\n\nA Parm-Error is an element that appears in a Result XML document that is used to indicate a failure when processing a corresponding parm in a Request XML document.\n\nIf the processing of a parm in a Request XML document by a CSP is unsuccessful, then the Result XML document will contain a Parm-Error element instead of a Parm element. The Parm-Error element will contain the same name and value as the failed Parm element plus a description explaining the reason for the failure. If a Result XML document contains a Parm-Error element, then it indicates that the behavior requested by the Request XML document could not be completely achieved.\n\n### Parm-Queries\n\nA Parm-Query is an element that appears in a Request XML document that is used to request a query of a single current configuration value of the subsystem managed by a CSP. Every Parm-Query must have a name that is unique within a given TLC, even across different SGCs within that TLC. A given Parm-Query can appear only once within a given TLC. It may appear more than once within an XML document if that XML document contains multiple TLCs and that Parm-Query appears only once within each TLC.\n\nA Parm-Query requests a value that is part of the current configuration of the subsystem managed by a CSP. It is used to request a current configuration value when sent in a Request XML document. The queried value will be returned via a Parm element in the Result XML document.\n\nIf the processing of a Parm-Query in a Request XML document by a CSP is successful, then the Result XML Document will contain a Parm Element, with the current Configuration Value of that Parm. \n\n### Parm-Query-Errors\n\nA Parm-Query-Error is an element that appears in a Result XML document that is used to indicate that a failure occurred when processing a corresponding Parm-Query element in a Request XML document. \n\nIf the processing of a Parm-Query in a Request XML document by a CSP is unsuccessful, then the Result XML document will contain a Parm-Query-Error element instead of a Parm element. The Parm-Query-Error element will contain the same name as the failed Parm-Query element plus a description explaining the reason for the failure.\n\n## Request and Result XML Documents\n\nTo request the MXMS to perform some behavior(s), a Request XML must be created and submitted to MXMS by a requesting application. A Request XML Document consists of one or more TLCs that define the behavior(s) requested by that Request XML Document. The MXMS breaks the Request XML Document into its component Request Top Level Characteristic (TLC) and delivers each Request TLC, in the order it appears in the Request XML Document, to a corresponding CSP.\n\nRequest TLCs in Request XML Documents can be used to perform three primary types of behaviors:\n\n1. Set Configuration - Almost every CSP supports a Request TLC that can be used to set or modify the configuration of the subsystem that is managed by that CSP\n2. Perform Action - Some CSPs support Request TLCs that can be used to perform discrete actions upon the subsystem managed by that CSP. This is opposed to behaviors that involve changing the configuration of the subsystem. For example, an action that could be performed through a CSP is rebooting the device. \n3. Query Configuration - Some CSPs support Request TLCs that can be used to obtain the current configuration of the subsystem managed by that CSP\n\nA CSP processes a Request TLC and returns a Result TLC or TLC Error based on the results of processing that TLC. The MXMS aggregates Request TLCs and TLC Errors into a Result XML document in the same order as the corresponding Request TLCs in the Request XML document. The MXMS returns the Result XML document to the requesting application to communicate the results of the attempt to perform the behavior(s) requested in the Request XML Document.\n\nQuery Configuration behaviors are not reflexive, which means that a Result XML document has an intentionally different format than a successfully completed Request XML document. The XML that is returned from a successful Query Configuration behavior will contain the information that was returned from the query, which is in the same format as Request XML documents and Result XML documents. This means that the result of a query is able to be used as a Request XML document for a Set Configuration behavior.\n\nA characteristic (either a TLC or SGC) in a Request XML document will result in one of the following in the Result XML document:\n\n* The request characteristic in the Request XML document was performed successfully by the corresponding CSP. This means that the characteristic in the Result XML document will be in the same format as the characteristic in the Request XML document.\n* The request characteristic was rejected by the corresponding CSP. This means that this characteristic will be a Characteristic-Error in the Result XML document.\n* The request characteristic was ignored by MXMS and not sent to the corresponding CSP. This means that neither a result characteristic nor a Characteristic-Error will appear in the corresponding location in the Result XML.\n\nA parm in a Request XML document will result in one of the following in the Result XML Document:\n\n* The request parm was accepted by the corresponding CSP, in which case, the value of that parm will be used by the CSP when performing the requested behavior. This means that the parm value in the Result XML document will be identical to the corresponding parm value in the Request XML, which indicates that the value was used successfully.\n* The request parm can be rejected by the corresponding CSP, in which case the parm value will not be used to perform a requested behavior. The CSP might consider this parm value to be critical and will return a Parm-Error element in the corresponding location in the Result XML document. Otherwise, the CSP might consider the parm value to be non-critical (i.e. merely a \"suggestion\") and will use a different value to perform the behavior. The CSP will then return the value that was actually used in the corresponding location of the Result XML document instead of the value specified in the Request XML document.\n\n\n## XML Equivalence\n\nTwo XML documents are equivalent if they represent the same data even if they do not have identical text. Two XML documents are equivalent if they differ only in white space, for example:\n\n\t:::XML\n\t<characteristic type=\"Wi-Fi\" version=\"2.1\" >\n\t\nvs.\n\n\t:::XML\n\t<characteristic type=\"Wi-Fi\"                       version=\"2.1\" >\n\nTwo XML documents may be equivalent if they differ only in order and order is not relevant, for example:\n\n\t:::XML\n\t<characteristic  version=\"2.1\" type=\"Wi-Fi\" >\n\t\nvs.\n\n\t:::XML\n\t<characteristic  type=\"Wi-Fi\" version=\"2.1\" >\t\n\nEquivalence is a key concept when taken together with the reflexive nature of Set Configuration and Perform Action behaviors. \"Total Success\" is indicated by Request and Result XML documents being equivalent since it means that what was done was exactly what was requested.\n\n## DSDs and Conditional Elements\n\nA primary purpose of a DSD is to provide the information required to present a viable Data-Driven UI to create XML that can be consumed by the CSP corresponding to that DSD.\n\nIn many cases, a CSP will support multiple use-cases, sub-use-cases, modes, options, or functions. In order to effectively describe such cases, the XML sent to a CSP may need to be conditional in nature. For example, the presence of one parm or characteristic may be optional depending on the value selected or entered for a prior parm. To reliably generate such conditional XML, the Data-Driven UI must reflect the conditional nature of the XML and hence the DSD can utilize the PresentIf attribute.\n\nA PresentIf attribute that is specified for a Characteristic or Parm element includes a Boolean expression that must be evaluated to determine whether that characteristic or parm should be \"presented\" within the Data-Driven UI. If a characteristic or parm is not presented, then no UI will be displayed based on those elements and they will not be present in the XML that is generated. This enables flexibility in the DSD, permitting definition of complex relationships.\n\n### Pivotal Parms\n\nUse the PresentIf attribute in Characteristic or Parm elements within a DSD causes certain Parm elements to become \"Pivotal\" with respect to the UI that will be displayed and the XML that will be generated.\n\nA Pivotal Parm is simply a parm where the value selected or entered determines which SGCs and/or parms will be presented by the UI and included in the generated XML. \n\nWhen using Data-Driven UI to generate XML, the Data-Driven UI will enforce the PresentIf attributes defined in the DSD and the generated XML will automatically be compliant to the DSD and therefore will be consumable by the corresponding CSP.\n\nBut when generating XML programmatically, it can be of critical importance to know about Pivotal Parms since failure to properly account for them can lead to the generation of XML does not conform to the DSD and hence cannot be successfully consumed by the corresponding CSP. In many cases, the existence of Pivotal Parms will indicate that the CSP can be used to accomplish multiple logical use cases, where each use case is achieved by taking a given path through the DSD by making certain selections for one or more Pivotal Parms.\n\n### Error Handling Rules\n\nIf a Result XML document is equivalent to the corresponding Request XML document, then it indicates a \"total success\" and that all of the behavior(s) that were requested were performed exactly as specified. However, if a Result XML Document contains any TLC errors, then the behaviors requested by the TLCs in the corresponding Request XML document were not performed at all. \n\nTo find out which behaviors were not performed and why, the TLC errors in the Result XML document will need to be examined. \n\nIf a Result XML document contains no TLC errors but is not equivalent to the corresponding Request XML document, then some of the behaviors requested by the corresponding Request XML document were either not performed or were performed but not exactly as specified. \n\nTo find out which behaviors were not executed, examine the SGC errors or Parm-Errors in the Result XML document. To find out which behaviors were executed, but not exactly as specified, examine the values of parms in the Result XML document and see how they differ from the requested values in the Request XML document.\n\n### CSPs and Enterprise and Factory Resets\n\nConfiguration performed by all CSPs is stored such that it is intentionally lost on every Enterprise Reset and Factory Reset. This means that the CSPs and the subsystems they manage intentionally do not store configuration in a manner that would cause it to be persistent across an Enterprise or Factory Reset. By definition, it is NOT possible to make any configuration persistent across Factory Reset since Factory Reset must always return a device to its Factory Default state and hence must discard all configuration that has been applied.\n\nHowever, it is possible to make Set Configuration behaviors effectively persistent across an Enterprise Reset by using the PersistMgr. This is done by appending a PersistMgr TLC to the Request XML document. The PersistMgr CSP will then store the entire Request XML document in a special secure location that will survive an Enterprise Reset. Following Enterprise Reset, the PersistMgr CSP will automatically resubmit all saved Request XML documents, thus effectively restoring their effects. \n\nA PersistMgr TLC can specify whether the containing Request XML document should always be saved or only if it was initially applied without TLC errors. Each Request XML document to be made persistent using the PersistMgr CSP must be given a unique name to identify it, which can then be used to later enumerate and/or remove saved Request XML documents. A PersistMgr TLC can specify the order in which various Request XML Documents should be reapplied following an Enterprise Reset. More information about the PersistMgr can be found in the CSP reference section.\n"}];
