# AppMgr

## About AppMgr

### Overview

The AppMgr Feature Type allows you manage the set of user applications that are installed on the device. On consumer Android devices, application management requires a device user to interact with UI presented on the device. In scenarios where a device is being managed by an MDM, it is often important for the MDM to tightly control which user applications are installed, without the need to involve a device user and without the consent or approval of a device user. The primary purpose of the AppMgr Feature Type is to manage user applications programmatically and silently. This enables an MDM to take full control of the set of user applications that are installed on the device.

The AppMgr Feature Type allows you to Install, Uninstall, Upgrade, and Turn On and Off the launching of applications. It also allows you to designate an application as the Default Launcher, which is the application that is invoked when the device user presses the HOME Key, and perform other tasks related to the management of applications.

When considering the capabilities of the AppMgr Feature Type, it is important to understand that applications can be divided into two classes: System applications and User applications. System applications are those applications that are built-into the device and hence are always installed. User applications are those applications that are not built-into the device and hence must be installed onto a device before they can be used. Some functions of the AppMgr Feature Type apply only to System applications, some apply only to User applications, and some apply to both. Each function will identify the classes of applications to which it applies.

### Main Functionality

* Install, Uninstall, and Upgrade User applications (with no device user involvement)
* Set an application to be the Default Launcher
* Turn On and Off the Launching of an application (Blacklisting)
* Clear the Recent Application List
* Enable and Disable Access to Application Info

	<p><b>Note:</b> When an application is upgraded, the data for that application is maintained.  This allows the new version of the application to access (and possibly convert) data created by the old version.</p>

	<p><b>Note:</b>  In devices running the Jelly Bean version of Android, an Upgrade can replace any version of an application with any other version of the same application. However, in devices running the KitKat or higher version of Android, an Upgrade can only replace an application with a higher (numerically greater) version of the same application. This change was made to reduce issues where an older version of an application maybe unable to understand data produced by a newer version.</p>

####APK Path and Name
Settable if: The Action is "Install" or "Upgrade"

Pivotal parm: No

Parm name: APK

Description: 

>Provide the path and name of the Android application APK file within the device file system that will be installed or upgraded.

>**Note:** An APK file can only be used to Install a User application because any application being installed from an APK file is not built-into the device and is therefore, by definition, a User Application. But an APK could be used to Upgrade either a System application or a User application. In order for any Upgrade to work, the APK file must be signed with the same developer certificate as the application it is trying to replace. If the APK file is not signed with the same developer certificate then an error will be returned in the Result XML document. This means that a System application can only be replaced using an APK file produced by the same developer that produced the built-in System application. If a System application is successfully Upgraded using an APK, the new version of the application is granted the same permissions as the version that was replaced. This allows the new version of the application to successfully perform the same operations as the original System application even though it is actually a User application. Since the new version is not built-into the device the device will revert to the old built-in version of the application whenever data is cleared.

Parm value input rules: 

* String containing the full path and name of an APK that resides on the device. For example, '/storage/sdcard1/Herald.apk'.
* The minimum length is 1 character and the maximum length is 255 characters

####Package Name
Settable if: The Action is "Uninstall", "Set as Default Launcher", "Enable Application", or "Disable Application"

**Note:** To perform the above listed Actions on an application, the Package Name of that application must be known and specified. The Package Name can be acquired from the application developer, by looking up the Package Name on a device, or using developer tools to extract the Package Name from the APK file.

Pivotal parm: No

Parm name: Package

Description: 

>Provide the Package Name of the application for the application action.

Parm value input rules: 

* String containing the valid name of the package. For example, 'com.mycompany.mypackage'.
* The minimum length is 1 character and the maximum length is 255 characters
* The package names must be separated by commas

### Protected List Action
Pivotal parm: Yes

Description: 

>The Protected List is a feature that allows certain applications to be exempted from certain constraints that are imposed on applications when Multi-User Mode is enabled. In particular, applications whose Package Names are on the Protected List will:

>* Be allowed to launch when no device user is logged in
>* Not be terminated when a device user logs out
>* Have only one copy of its data for all users, even if Multi-User Data Separation is enabled

>**Note:** Multi-User Mode is supported on all Zebra Android devices that support Zebra MX functionality, but the AccessMgr Feature Type currently does not support enabling Multi-User Mode. Multi-User Mode can be enabled on devices that support it, but only using unsupported tools or mechanisms that do not scale to large deployments. For this reason, the ability to use the AppMgr Feature Type to manage the Protected List may provide little or no immediate benefit. In the future, when the AccessMgr Feature Type is enhanced to support enabling Multi-User Mode, the ability to use the AppMgr Feature Type to manage the Protected List will likely be more meaningful.

    <td>Remove All Application from Protected List</td>
    <td>"ClearProtectedList"</td>
	<td>This value will cause all Package Names to be Removed from the Protected List.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>	

####Package Name
Settable if: The Protected List Action is "Add Application to Protected List" or "Remove Application from Protected List"

Pivotal parm: No

Parm name: ProtectedListPackage

Description: 

>Provide the Package Name of the application that should be Added to or Removed from the Protected List.

Parm value input rules: 

* String containing the valid name of the package. For example, 'com.mycompany.mypackage'.
* The minimum length is 1 character and the maximum length is 255 characters
* The package names must be separated by commas

### Access to App Info Action

Pivotal parm: No

Parm name: AccessAppInfoAction

Description: 

>Since the AppMgr Feature Type allows control of which applications are installed, it may be of concern that a device user can use the App Info section of the in-device System Settings Menu to impact an installed application.  A device user might terminate an application (Force Stop), remove application data (Clear Data), etc.  A device user might also Uninstall the application completely.  If an MDM is being used to tightly control the set of installed applications on a device, such activities by a device user might be undesirable.

>This may be compounded by the fact that the App Info section of the System Settings Menu may be reached from a variety of places in the device UI, not just from the main System Settings Menu.  For example, App Info can be reached for an application from the Android Recent Applications List or from a notification related to the application in the Android Notification Area.

>To prevent device users from using App Info to alter the configured set of installed applications, it may be desirable to prevent the device user from accessing App Info altogether.  Of course, you could use the AppMgr Feature Type to disable launching of the System Settings Menu application, which would prevent access to App Info.  But that would also prevent access to all other aspects of the System Settings Menu.  A more targeted approach would be to block only App Info.

>This allows you to enable or disable all access to App Info for all applications without blocking access to other parts of the System Settings Menu.  By disabling App Info, you can prevent the device user from getting to App Info and using it to interfere with the configured set of installed applications.

>**Note:** This parm is supported only on devices that are running the Kit Kat version of Android.  This is because this parm depends on modifications made to the System Settings Menu application, and those modifications are found only on Kit Kat devices.
