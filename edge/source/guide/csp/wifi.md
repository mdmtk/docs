# Wi-Fi

## About Wi-Fi

### Overview

The Wi-Fi feature type allows you to manage a device's Wi-Fi settings as well as manage the network profiles to be used for connecting and remembering networks.

> **Note:** In other CSPs, the terms "enable" and "disable" refer to whether or not the user will be allowed to turn the device on or off at all. However, in this CSP, "enable" and "disable" are equivalent to "turn on" and "turn off".

##Parameter Notes
### Target OS
Pivotal parm: Yes

Description: 

>Specify the target OS of the device.

<div class="parm-table">
 <table>
	<tr>
		<th>Parm Option Name</th>
		<th>Parm Value</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Android</td>
    <td>"2"</td>
    <td>This value (or the absence of this parm from the XML) will set the Target OS to Android.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>
	
### Wi-Fi Enable 
Pivotal parm: No

Parm name: WiFiAction

Description: 

>Turn the Wi-Fi radio on or off.

> **Note:** In order for settings to be applied, Wi-Fi must be turned on. If you do not specify WiFi Enable in the profile, you will get an error when attempting to apply certain settings if the device's Wi-Fi is not already turned on. For example, all of the Network Actions, which are described later in this document, will require that Wi-Fi is turned on. However, other settings, such as Sleep Policy and Network Notification, do not require Wi-Fi to be turned on.

>As a best practice, it is recommended that this is turned on whenever setting another Wi-Fi parm that requires to be on, as it is not harmful to enable the Wi-Fi again if it is already on.

> **Note:** In other CSPs, the terms "enable" and "disable" refer to whether or not the user will be allowed to turn the device on or off at all. However, in this CSP, "enable" and "disable" are equivalent to "turn on" and "turn off".



<div class="parm-table">
 <table>
	<tr>
		<th>Parm Option Name</th>
		<th>Parm Value</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Do not change</td>
    <td>"0"</td>
	<td>This value (or the absence of this parm from the XML) will not make any change to the whether the Wi-Fi radio is on or off.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Enable</td>
    <td>"enable"</td>
	<td>This value will cause the Wi-Fi radio to be turned on.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Disable</td>
    <td>"disable"</td>
	<td>This value will cause the Wi-Fi radio to be turned off.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>	

### Sleep Policy
Pivotal parm: No

Parm name: WifiSleepPolicy

Description: 
>Specifies the state of the Wi-Fi radio when the device suspends.

>For Android devices, the device is suspended when the display turns off after idling for a certain amount of time. While the device is suspended, the device's software continues running in a lower power mode, meaning that the device itself is not turned off and software can run when the device is in this state. The amount of power consumption while in this state partially depends on what features are left on.

<div class="parm-table">
 <table>
	<tr>
		<th>Parm Option Name</th>
		<th>Parm Value</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Do not change</td>
    <td>""</td>
	<td>This value (or the absence of this parm from the XML) will not make any change to the current sleep policy on the device.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Never Sleep</td>
    <td>"AlwaysOn"</td>
	<td>This value will leave the Wi-Fi radio on while the device's display is turned off and Wi-Fi can continue to be used by any software that is running. Existing Wi-Fi connections will be maintained as if the device was not suspended. For example, emails will continue to come in. This behavior may be preferred in some situations. However, this could significantly increase the drain on the battery and reduce the battery life.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Never Sleep When Plugged</td>
    <td>"PluggedIn"</td>
	<td>This value will leave the Wi-Fi radio on while the display is turned off if the device is not running from battery power.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Always Sleep</td>
    <td>"NeverOn"</td>
	<td>This value turns the Wi-Fi radio off while the device's display is turned off. Existing Wi-Fi connections will be dropped and will need to be re-established, if needed, when the display (and Wi-Fi) are turned back on. Software that is running cannot use Wi-Fi while it is off. This can significantly increase the battery life if communications are not needed when the device is suspended.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>

### Network Notification
Pivotal parm: No

Parm name: NetworkNotification

Description: 
>Specifies whether or not to notify the user when an unknown, open network comes in range. If this setting is turned on, the user will be asked if they want to join the network, which could be useful for personal or dual use devices which might want to use a public Wi-Fi connection at some point. However, turning these notifications on is not recommended for devices that are supposed to be used only on a single corporate Wi-Fi network since it might be harmful to offer a user the opportunity to connect to a rogue, non-secure network.

 <div class="parm-table">
 <table>
	<tr>
		<th>Parm Option Name</th>
		<th>Parm Values</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Do not change</td>
    <td>""</td>
	<td>This value (or the absence of this parm from the XML) will not make any change to the current network notification setting.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Use network notification</td>
    <td>"true"</td>
	<td>This value will cause the user to be notified when an unknown, open network comes into range</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Do not use network notification</td>
    <td>"false"</td>
	<td>This value will cause the user to not be notified when an unknown, open network comes into range</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>

### Country Selection Auto/Manual
Pivotal parm: Yes

Description: 
>By leaving this option unchecked, the country may be determined by the router or access point setting. To manually select the country, you should select the checkbox. When doing this a country drop-down will appear.

#### Country
Settable if: The "Configure Country (Auto/Manual)" box is not checked

Pivotal parm: No

Parm name: Country

Description: 
>Sets the country to use for Wi-Fi regulatory setting. 

>When you choose 'AUTO' in the drop-down, 802.11d will be enabled. 802.11d is a mode where the device will listen for a country-specific beacon. It also will not transmit unless it can auto-detect the country, which can be beneficial because the device cannot transmit with a frequency that is inconsistent with the Wi-Fi infrastructure and is therefore less likely to violate country-specific regulations.

>If a Wi-Fi infrastructure does not support, 802.11d, then the country that is used by this infrastructure will need to be selected so that the device can connect to it.

### RF Band
Pivotal parm: Yes

Description: 
>Specifies the 802.11 band(s) to use. The bands to use will usually be determined automatically through negotiation with the Wi-Fi infrastructure. However, in some cases, the Wi-Fi infrastructure may be shared amongst multiple uses, which may mean that it would be preferable to limit the devices to one band and leave the other bands for other purposes. 

<div class="parm-table">

#### 2.4GHz Channels 
Settable if: The RF Band that is selected is either 2.4GHz or Auto

Pivotal parm: No

Parm name: 2.4GHzChannels

Description: 
>Enable the specified channels in the 2.4GHz band. In most cases, if the 2.4GHZ band is allowed to be used, then the channels in this band that should be used can be determined automatically through negotiation with the Wi-Fi infrastructure. However, it may be beneficial to control the channels manually because different channels or sets of channels might be used for different uses. It may be preferable to limit the devices to only use certain channels so that other channels are left for other purposes. 

Parm value input rules: 

* String containing a set of valid channels.
	* Not all channels are available in all every country. Please see the link below for more information:
		* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels
* The minimum length is 0 characters and the maximum length is 64 characters.
* Comma separated and may contain a range specified with a dash '-'. Example: 1,7-10

#### 5.0GHz Channels 
Settable if: The RF Band that is selected is either 5.0GHz or Auto

Pivotal parm: No

Parm name: 5.0GHzChannels

Description: 
>Enable the specified channels in the 5.0GHz band. In most cases, if the 5.0GHZ band is allowed to be used, then the channels in this band that should be used can be determined automatically through negotiation with the Wi-Fi infrastructure. However, it may be beneficial to control the channels manually because different channels or sets of channels might be used for different uses.

### Specify Diagnostic Options
Pivotal parm: Yes

Description: 
>Specify whether Diagnostic Options will be used. When turned on, Fusion Advanced Logging can also be turned on. This option can be used to collect additional information for troubleshooting but can impact the performance of a device.

> **Note:** In most cases, this option should not be used except under the direction of Zebra support staff.

#### Fusion Advanced Logging
Settable if: The "Specify Diagnostic Options" box is checked

Pivotal parm: No

Parm name: FusionAdvancedLogging

Description: 
>Specify whether Fusion Advanced Logging will be used

### Specify Advanced Options

Description: 
>Specify whether Advanced Options will be used. In most cases, these options should not be used except under the direction of Zebra support staff. More information about the Advanced Options that can be set, please see [this page.](../guide/csp/wifiAdvancedOptions)

### Network Action
Pivotal parm: Yes

Description: 
>This is used to manage the Wi-Fi network profiles on the device. A given device can have zero or more Wi-Fi network profiles defined, which are used to specify the information that is needed for the device to connect to a single Wi-Fi network. These profiles can each be enabled or disabled. An enabled Wi-Fi network profile can be used to connect to a network and a disabled profile cannot be used to connect to a network. At any given time, the device can be connected to at most one network using a corresponding Wi-Fi network profile. The potential network connections are controlled by which profiles are defined and enabled on the device. It is also possible to force a connection to the network associated with a specific Wi-Fi network profile.

#### Authentication Details
Specific authentication settings when Enterprise Mode and specific Authentication modes are selected.

##### **Identity**
Settable if: The Network Action is "Add a New Network" *AND* the Security Mode is "Enterprise"

Pivotal parm: No

Parm name: Identity

Description: 
>Identity is used only when Authentication is used, which also means that this is only used when the Security Mode is "Enterprise". 

>This parm is used by the device to specify to the Authentication Server the Identity that it wishes to authenticate as. The Identity is synonymous with "user name" in many cases. However, different Authentication Servers can be configured to require different types of Identity, such as email addresses, device unique ID, etc. 

>The Identity is used as a way of getting accepted by the Authentication Server so that you can receive the encryption key that is needed to operate on the network. Once you are authenticated, the Identity does not have any further meaning and is not used to identify the device on the network.

>Specifying an empty (length of zero) value (or the absence of this parm from the XML) will cause the Identity will not be set.


##### **Anonymous Identity** 
Settable if: The Network Action is "Add a New Network" *AND* the Security Mode is "Enterprise" *AND* the Authentication is not "EAP-TLS" or "LEAP"

Pivotal parm: No

Parm name: AnonymousIdentity

Description: 
>When using an EAP type that has a secure tunnel over which authentication credentials can be delivered, it may be necessary to specify an Identity outside the tunnel as well as an Identity inside the tunnel. To protect the actual Identity from disclosure when sending it outside the tunnel, an Anonymous Identity can be sent outside the tunnel and the actual Identity, along with the password or other verifying credentials, can be sent inside the tunnel.

>If no Anonymous Identity is specified, then the actual Identity will be sent outside the tunnel, if required. This may not be a problem since the password or other verifying credentials is only sent inside the tunnel, in modes that use a tunnel for secure credential delivery. So, using the actual Identity outside the tunnel would only risk disclosure of part of the information needed to authenticate. A separate Anonymous Identity can only be used if the Authentication Server is set up to support such use.

>Specifying an empty (length of zero) value (or the absence of this parm from the XML) will cause the Anonymous Identity will not be set.

Parm value input rules: 

* String with a minimum of 0 characters and a maximum of 64 characters

##### **Protect Password**
Settable if: The Network Action is "Add a New Network" *AND* the Security Mode is "Enterprise" *AND* the Authentication is not "EAP-TLS"

Pivotal parm: No

Parm name: ProtectPassword

Description: 
>A Password is an authentication credential that is used to prove the authenticity of an Identity and therefore, is only used when the Security Mode is "Enterprise". All Authentication types require a Password except EAP-TLS, which uses a client certificate instead of a Password.

>In most cases, it is important to protect a Password since, combined with the matching Identity, it can be used to authenticate and gain access to a network. Since the Password must be embedded within the XML, it is often desirable to encrypt the Password so that i cannot be extracted and exploited if the XML is intercepted. The ProtectPassword parm is used to indicate whether the Password will be specified in clear, unencrypted text or in encrypted form.

##### **Password** 
Pivotal parm: Yes

Description: 
>The password to be used to connect to the network. The parm name will change depending on the value of ProtectPassword.

> **Note:** Currently, the parm value encryption process is not documented and the key that is needed to encrypt is not published. Therefore, an MDM cannot currently use an encrypted password since there is no way to store an encrypted, server-supplied password in an XML.

Parm value input rules: 

* String with a minimum of 0 characters and a maximum of 64 characters

If Protect Password is false:

* Settable if: The Network Action is "Add a New Network" *AND* the Security Mode is "Enterprise" *AND* Authentication is not "EAP-TLS" *AND* Protect Password is false
* Parm name: PasswordClear

If Protect Password is true:

* Settable if: The Network Action is "Add a New Network" *AND* the Security Mode is "Enterprise" *AND* Authentication is not "EAP-TLS" *AND* Protect Password is true
* Parm name: PasswordEncrypted

##### **Server Certificate Name (optional)**
Settable if: The Network Action is "Add a New Network" *AND* the Security Mode is "Enterprise" *AND* the Authentication is "EAP-TLS", "PEAP-MSCHAPV2", "EAP-TTLS-MSCHAP", "EAP-FAST-MSCHAPV2", "EAP-TTLS-PAP", "PEAP-GTC", "EAP-FAST-MSCHAPV2", or "EAP-FAST-GTC"

Pivotal parm: No

Parm name: OptionalServerCertificate

Description: 
>The name of the certificate alias that should be used to verify the server (Optional).

>When Security Mode is "Enterprise", the device will not need to authenticate to an Authentication Server using the defined Authentication type. This will involve sending potentially sensitive authentication credentials to the Authentication Server. It is usually not recommended to do this unless the authenticity of the Authentication Server can be verified, for example, ensuring it is not a "man in the middle".

>The device contacts and challenges the Authentication Server to assert and prove its Identity through the use of a server certificate. The device must be able to establish the validity of that certificate and must trust the chain of authority of the issuer of that certificate. This would all occur whether or not a Server Certificate Name is specified.

>By default, a certificate asserted by an Authentication Server will be trusted if it can be verified to have been validly issued by any trusted certificate authority. If a Server Certificate Name is supplied, then the certificate asserted by an Authentication Server will be trusted only if it is verified to have been validly issued by that specific trusted certificate authority. This increases the security by preventing the use of certificates issued by authorities that are not trusted to issue certificates to authentication servers.

>Specifying an empty (length of zero) value (or the absence of this parm from the XML) will cause the Optional Server Certificate to not be set.

Parm value input rules: 

* String with a minimum of 0 characters and a maximum of 64 characters

##### **Client Certificate Name (mandatory)**
Settable if: The Network Action is "Add a New Network" and the Security Mode is "Enterprise" and the Authentication is "EAP-TLS"

Pivotal parm: No

Parm name: MandatoryClientCertificate

Description: 
>The name of the certificate alias that should be used to join the network (Mandatory). When Authenticating using EAP-TLS, a client certificate is used instead of a Password. Consequently, when Authentication is EAP-TLS, a client certificate must be specified and a Password must not be specified.

Parm value input rules: 

* String with a minimum of 0 characters and a maximum of 64 characters

##### **Client Certificate Name (optional)**
Settable if: The Network Action is "Add a New Network" and the Security Mode is "Enterprise" the Authentication is "PEAP-MSCHAPV2", "EAP-TTLS-MSCHAP", "EAP-TTLS-MSCHAPV2", "EAP-TTLS-PAP", "PEAP-GTC", "EAP-FAST-MSCHAPV2", or "EAP-FAST-GTC"

Pivotal parm: No

Parm name: OptionalClientCertificate

Description: 
>The name of the certificate alias that should be used to join the network (Optional). When Authenticating using EAP types other than EAP-TLS, which would not require a client certificate, a client is still allowed. If used, the client certificate will be used to authenticate the device to the authentication server as part of the establishment of the secure tunnel over which further authentication credentials will be delivered. This means that the client certificate do not need to be unique, even if the authentication credentials are. The use of a client certificate can introduce an additional level of protection by requiring a device to possess a valid client certificate as well as valid authentication credentials. The client certificate serves as a first pass filter.

>Specifying an empty (length of zero) value (or the absence of this parm from the XML) will cause the Optional Server Certificate to not be set.

Parm value input rules: 

* String with a minimum of 0 characters and a maximum of 64 characters

##### **EAP-TLS and Certificate Alias**
Due to current limitations of the Certificate Manager Feature (in an EAP-TLS scenario), it is not possible to "override" the Alias that is assigned to a Client Certificate and Private Key when they are installed into the Android KeyStore

The only way to determine the actual Alias that is assigned to a Client Certificate and Private Key when they are installed into the Android KeyStore is to examine the Android KeyStore after installation to determine which Alias was used:

1. The same Alias will ALWAYS be assigned to a given Client Certificate and Private Key, no matter when, or on which device, it is installed

2. Whenever a different Client Certificate is used, a different Alias will generally be assigned to the Client Certificate and Private Key

###### **Manually Determining the Certificate Alias**
A device can be used to capture the alias being used for the certificate being installed. It is recommended that the key store be cleared before performing these steps (Settings->Security->Clear Credentials)

1. Use Certificate Manager to install the certificate onto a device.
2. Navigate to Settings->Wi-Fi->'+'' to add a network
3. Scroll to security, tap and select 802.1x EAP
4. Scroll to EAP method, tap and select TLS
5. Scroll to client certificate, tap and note a drop down box with "(unspecified)" and the alias of the installed certificate. The alias listed can become the value to use as the certificate when using WiFiConfig to configure a profile that uses EAP-TLS.

#### Encryption Type
Pivotal parm: No

Description: 
>Type of encryption used by the network. The values that can be selected for Encryption Type will vary based on the selections made for Security Mode and WPA Mode. But a selection must always be made for Encryption Type whenever Security Mode is not "Open" (indicating no encryption).

>An encryption key can be specified using one of two methods: 

>* A hexadecimal value of the actual key
>* A passphrase that can be used to generate a key using a pre-defined algorithm

>The method that is used usually depends on the configuration of the Wi-Fi infrastructure that implements the network. This is because the key to be used must be known to both the Wi-Fi infrastructure and the client. Therefore, both must use a common method to specify that key.

##### **Passphrase**
Pivotal parm: No

Description:

##### **WEP Key Index**
Settable if: The Network Action is "Add a New Network" *AND* the Security Mode is "Personal" *AND* the WPA Mode is "WEP"

Pivotal parm: No

Parm name: WepKeyIndex

Description: 
>Some Wi-Fi infrastructure that implements a network using WEP encryption may support multiple WEP keys and a WEP index to indicate which key to use at any given time. 

> **Note:** Android does not currently support multiple WEP keys per network. Therefore, only the first WEP key (`wep[0]`) is supported.

#### Use DHCP
Pivotal parm: Yes

Description: 

>When this parm is selected, DHCP will be used. When not selected, Static IP address is used.

>Most modern networks use DHCP to automatically assign IP Addresses to devices when they join the network. If DHCP is used, then all requisite IP Address information will be obtained automatically and no additional information will need to be provided.

>If DHCP cannot be used for a particular network, then all IP Address information that is needed to operate on that network will need to be specified. None of the following IP Address information parms can be left blank, but they may not all require meaningful values, depending on the network.

##### **Static IP Address**
Settable if: The Network Action is "Add a New Network" *AND* the "Use DHCP" box is not checked

Pivotal parm: No

Parm name: IpAddress

Description: 
>Provide the static IP address to be assigned to the device on this network. 

>When not using DHCP, a valid IP Address for the device to use on the network must be specified and that IP Address must not be assigned to any other device on the same network.

Parm value input rules: 

* Must be a valid IPV4 address, example: 191.168.0.1

##### **Gateway 1 IP Address**
Settable if: The Network Action is "Add a New Network" *AND* the "Use DHCP" box is not checked

Pivotal parm: No

Parm name: IpGateway1

Description: 
>Provide the IP address of the first gateway to the network.

>When not using DHCP, a valid Gateway IP Address may or may not be required. If there is a Gateway that can route traffic out of the current network, then the IP Address of that Gateway should be specified if the device will need to send traffic outside that network. If the network is essentially self-contained, then it may not be important what value is specified for this parm.

Parm value input rules: 

* Must be a valid IPV4 address, example: 191.168.0.1

##### **Subnet Mask**
Settable if: The Network Action is "Add a New Network" *AND* the "Use DHCP" box is not checked

Pivotal parm: No

Parm name: IpMask

Description: 
>Provide the subnet mask to be used on the network.

>When not using DHCP, a subnet mask must be specified that is consistent with the network and is consistent with the IP Address assigned to the device for use on that network.

Parm value input rules: 

* Must be a valid IPV4 subnet mask, example: 255.255.255.0

##### **DNS Server 1 IP Address**
Settable if: The Network Action is "Add a New Network" *AND* the "Use DHCP" box is not checked

Pivotal parm: No

Parm name: IpDns1

Description: 
>Provide the IP address of the first DNS server.

>When not using DHCP, a valid DNS Server IP Address may or may not be required. If there is a DNS Server that can resolve network names to IP Addresses on the current network, then the IP Address of that server should be specified if the device will need to resolve names for that network. If name resolution is not required, then it may not be important what value is specified for this parm.

Parm value input rules: 

* Must be a valid IPV4 address, example: 191.168.0.1

##### **DNS Server 2 IP Address**
Settable if: The Network Action is "Add a New Network" *AND* the "Use DHCP" box is not checked

Pivotal parm: No

Parm name: IpDns2

Description: 
>Provide the IP address of the second DNS server. When not using DHCP, a valid DNS Server IP Address may or may not be required. If there is a secondary DNS Server that can resolve network names to IP Addresses on the current network, then the IP Address of that server may be specified as a backup. If no alternate DNS Server is available or required, then it may not be important what value is specified for this parm.

>Specifying an empty (length of zero) value (or the absence of this parm from the XML) will cause the DNS Server 2 IP Address to not be set.

Parm value input rules: 

* Must be a valid IPV4 address, example: 191.168.0.1

#### Use Proxy
Pivotal parm: Yes

Description: 
>When selected, a Proxy is used for network connections. A proxy is a an intermediary service that routes HTTP requests and responses between clients on a device and another network (typically the internet or an intranet). When there is a proxy between the Wi-Fi network and some outer network, then HTTP-based applications, such as a Web Browser, may need to negotiate with that proxy to access the services of that outer network.

##### **Proxy Host Name**
Settable if: The Network Action is "Add a New Network" *AND* "Use Proxy" box is checked

Pivotal parm: No

Parm name: ProxyHostName

Description: 
>Provide the Host Name or IP Address of the computer on which the proxy is running. Host Name can be used only if the network provides suitable name resolution. Otherwise, an IP Address would need to be provided.

>Since different Wi-Fi networks may have different proxies connecting them to different outer networks, proxy information, if needed, must be configured for each network.

Parm value input rules: 

* String with a minimum of 1 characters and a maximum of 64 characters

##### **Proxy Port**
Settable if: The Network Action is "Add a New Network" *AND* "Use Proxy" box is checked

Pivotal parm: No

Parm name: ProxyPort

Description: 
>Provide the port number of the proxy server on the computer on which the proxy is running on which the proxy is listening.

##### **Bypass Proxy**
Settable if: The Network Action is "Add a New Network" *AND* "Use Proxy" box is checked

Pivotal parm: No

Parm name: BypassProxy

Description: 
>Once a proxy is configured for a given network, all HTTP traffic will generally be routed to the outer network via that proxy.  

>In some cases, it may be desirable to avoid routing selected Host Names or IP Addresses through the proxy. For example, you might want to access a local Web Server. This can be accomplished by listing the Host Names or IP Addresses for which the Proxy should be bypassed. To specify multiple Host Names or IP Addresses, separate them with commas.

Parm value input rules: 

* String with a maximum of 256 characters
